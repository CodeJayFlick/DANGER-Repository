This code defines a `Memory` class that provides methods for reading and writing data to/from a database using various types of storage (e.g., files, arrays). The class also includes several overloaded versions of these methods with different parameters.

The main method is the `deleteFileBytes()` method which takes in a file bytes object as an argument. This method checks if any memory blocks are referenced and returns true or false accordingly.
