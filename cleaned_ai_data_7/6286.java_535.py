This is an example of a Java method that uses nested try-catch blocks to handle exceptions. The method takes no arguments and returns nothing.

The outermost block catches any `Exception` type, while the inner blocks are specific to certain types of exceptions (`NullPointerException`, `IOException`, etc.). Each block has its own comment explaining what it does.
