## 1. Introduction

The `@Test` annotation is used to mark a method as a test method in JUnit. The `@Test` annotation can be used on any public or protected void, non-void returning method that takes no arguments and has the name starting with "test". For example:

```java
@Test
public void testSomething() {
    // Test code here
}
