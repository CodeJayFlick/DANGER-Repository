# Note: The MDMang class and its methods are not directly translatable to Python.
# In the given Java code, it seems that MDMang is used as a parameter in the constructor of MDUnknownRExtendedDataType. 
# If you want to replicate this functionality in Python, you would need to create your own equivalent class or use an existing one if available.
