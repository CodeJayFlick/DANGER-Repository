Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class TestTableData:
    def __init__(self, data: list, sort_context):
        super().__init__(data, sort_context)
```

Note that in this translation, I have removed some parts as they are not directly translatable to Python. Here's a brief explanation of the changes made:

1. The Java package declaration and import statements were omitted because these concepts do not exist in Python.
2. The `ROW_OBJECT` type parameter was also removed since Python does not support generics like Java does.
3. The class comment block was left out as it is more relevant to documentation than actual code functionality.

The rest of the translation focused on converting method declarations and object initialization into their equivalent forms in Python.
