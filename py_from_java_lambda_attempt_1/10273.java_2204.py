Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import os
from io import BytesIO

class JarArchiveBuilder:
    def __init__(self, output_file):
        with open(output_file, 'wb') as f:
            self.archive = BytesIO()
            super().__init__(BytesIO())

# Example usage:
output_file = "example.jar"
builder = JarArchiveBuilder(output_file)
```
Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `JarOutputStream` class. Instead, we use the built-in `io.BytesIO` class to create an in-memory file-like object.

Also, since Python is dynamically typed and has no concept of packages or imports like Java, I've simply defined the `JarArchiveBuilder` class as a standalone module.
