Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class DummyCancellableTaskMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cancel_enabled = True

    def set_cancel_enabled(self, enabled: bool) -> None:
        self.cancel_enabled = enabled
```
Note that I did not translate the Java comments to Python, as they are not necessary in Python. Also, I used a simple attribute `cancel_enabled` instead of implementing an interface or overriding methods like in the original Java code.
