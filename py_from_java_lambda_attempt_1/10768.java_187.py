Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python

class VgSatelliteContext:
    def __init__(self, provider):
        super().__init__(provider)
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `package`, `import` statements or comments (`/* */`). Also, the concept of classes and inheritance is similar in both languages.
