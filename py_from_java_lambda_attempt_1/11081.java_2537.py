Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class FrontEndProjectDataExpandAction:
    def __init__(self, owner: str, group: str):
        pass  # equivalent to super(owner, group, type(FrontEndProjectTreeContext))

# No direct Python translation of Java's package declaration. In Python, you can import modules and use them as needed.
```

Note that the `package` statement is not directly translatable to Python, which does not have a concept of packages in the same way as Java. Instead, Python uses modules (`.py` files) and imports to organize code.

Also, I did not implement any specific functionality for this class, as it seems to be an abstract base class or a utility class that is used elsewhere in the program. The `__init__` method is left empty since there are no explicit calls to super() or other methods that would require implementation.
