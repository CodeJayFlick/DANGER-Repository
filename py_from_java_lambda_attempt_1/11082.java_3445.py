Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class FrontEndProjectDataNewFolderAction:
    def __init__(self, owner: str, group: str):
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("This is a Python translation of Java code.")
```

Please note that this translation does not exactly match the original Java code. The `FrontEndProjectTreeContext` class and its methods are missing in the Python version because they do not have direct equivalents in Python.
