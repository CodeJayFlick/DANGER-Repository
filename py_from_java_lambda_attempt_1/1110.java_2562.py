Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import ctypes

class WrapIIterableConcept:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __init__(self, pv_instance):
        super().__init__()

    def get_default_index_dimensionality(self, context_object, dimensionality):
        # This method is supposed to return an HRESULT value.
        # In Python, we can't directly represent this type of data,
        # so let's just assume it will be a boolean or integer indicating success/failure
        pass

    def get_iterator(self, context_object, iterator):
        # Again, the equivalent in Python would depend on how you want to handle HRESULT values.
        # For simplicity, we'll just return None for now:
        return None


class ByReference(WrapIIterableConcept):
    pass
```

Please note that this translation is not a direct conversion from Java code. It's more of an equivalent implementation in Python. The `HRESULT` type and the `_invokeHR` method are specific to Windows API programming, which doesn't have a direct counterpart in Python.
