Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class ToolListener:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def process_tool_event(self, tool_event: 'PluginEvent'):
        """This method is invoked when the registered PluginEvent event occurs."""
        # Your code here to handle the plugin event
```

Please note that in Python, interfaces are not a built-in concept like they are in Java. Instead, we use abstract base classes (ABCs) or protocols from third-party libraries like `typing` for type hinting purposes only.

In this translation:

- The interface is translated into a class.
- The method signature remains the same with public access modifier removed as Python does not have explicit access modifiers.
- Type hints are added to indicate that the method takes an instance of 'PluginEvent' and returns None.
