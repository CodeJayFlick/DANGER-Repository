Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AssemblyGrammarException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, msg):
        super().__init__(msg)

    def __init__(self, msg, cause):
        super().__init__(msg)
        self.__cause__ = cause
```

Note that in Python, we don't need to specify the type of a variable when declaring it. Also, Python's exception handling is different from Java's. In Python, all exceptions are instances of the base class `Exception`. The equivalent of Java's checked exceptions (like `AssemblyException`) do not exist in Python; instead, you can raise any kind of object as an exception.

In this translation, we're creating a custom exception class called `AssemblyGrammarException` that inherits from Python's built-in `Exception` class. We have two constructors (`__init__` methods): one takes only the error message and another takes both the error message and the cause (which is equivalent to Java's `Throwable`).
