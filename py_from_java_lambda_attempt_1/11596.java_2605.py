Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class OpBehaviorBoolNegate:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(PcodeOp.BOOL_NEGATE)

    def evaluate_unary(self, sizeout: int, sizein: int, in1) -> int:
        return ~in1

    def evaluate_big_integer_unary(self, sizeout: int, sizein: int, in1: 'BigInteger') -> 'BigInteger':
        from sympy import BigInteger
        return in1 ^ BigInteger(1)
```

Note that Python does not have a built-in `BigInteger` type like Java's. I used the SymPy library to create a similar functionality for handling big integers.

Also note that this code is written with Python 3.x syntax and uses some advanced features such as type hints, which are available in Python 3.5 and later versions.
