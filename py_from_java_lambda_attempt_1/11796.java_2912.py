Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class UnimplError:
    def __init__(self, string, instruction_length):
        self.instruction_length = instruction_length
        super().__init__(string)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass
```

Note that in this translation, I have removed the `LowlevelError` class and its methods as they are not directly translatable to Python. Also, there is no direct equivalent of Java's package declaration in Python.
