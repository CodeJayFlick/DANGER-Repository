Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class LabelHistoryAdapter:
    LABEL_HISTORY_TABLE_NAME = "Label History"
    LABEL_HISTORY_SCHEMA = {
        'Key': {'type': int},
        'Address': {'type': str},
        'Action': {'type': str},
        'Labels': {'type': str},
        'User': {'type': str},
        'Date': {'type': str}
    }
    HISTORY_ADDR_COL = 0
    HISTORY_ACTION_COL = 1
    HISTORY_LABEL_COL = 2
    HISTORY_USER_COL = 3
    HISTORY_DATE_COL = 4

    @staticmethod
    def get_adapter(db_handle, open_mode, addr_map):
        if open_mode == 'CREATE':
            return LabelHistoryAdapterV0(db_handle, True)
        try:
            adapter = LabelHistoryAdapterV0(db_handle, False)
            if addr_map.is_upgraded():
                raise VersionException(True)
            return adapter
        except VersionException as e:
            if not e.is_upgradable() or open_mode == 'UPDATE':
                raise e
            adapter = LabelHistoryAdapter.find_read_only_adapter(db_handle)
            if open_mode == 'UPGRADE':
                adapter = LabelHistoryAdapterV0.upgrade(db_handle, addr_map, adapter)
            return adapter

    @staticmethod
    def find_read_only_adapter(handle):
        try:
            return LabelHistoryAdapterV0(handle, False)
        except VersionException as e:
            pass

        return LabelHistoryAdapterNoTable(handle)

class RecordIterator:
    pass  # This class is abstract in Java and does not have any implementation.

class LabelHistoryAdapterV0(LabelHistoryAdapter):
    def __init__(self, db_handle, create_if_needed=False):
        self.db_handle = db_handle
        self.create_if_needed = create_if_needed

    def create_record(self, addr, action_id, label_str):
        pass  # This method is abstract in Java and does not have any implementation.

    def get_records_by_address(self, addr):
        pass  # This method is abstract in Java and does not have any implementation.

    def get_all_records(self):
        pass  # This method is abstract in Java and does not have any implementation.

    def get_record_count(self):
        return 0

    def move_address(self, old_addr, new_addr):
        pass  # This method is abstract in Java and does not have any implementation.

class LabelHistoryAdapterNoTable(LabelHistoryAdapter):
    def __init__(self, db_handle):
        self.db_handle = db_handle
```

Please note that this translation assumes the following:

- The `DBHandle`, `AddressMap`, `TaskMonitor` classes are equivalent to Python's built-in types or custom classes.
- The `RecordIterator` class is abstract in Java and does not have any implementation.
