Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class SegmentMismatchException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message="The segments of the addresses do not match."):
        super().__init__(message)

def main():
    try:
        # example usage
        raise SegmentMismatchException()
    except SegmentMismatchException as e:
        print(e)
```
Note that I've used Python's built-in `Exception` class to create a custom exception class, and the `__init__` method is similar to the constructor in Java. The rest of the code is just an example usage of the exception.

Also, keep in mind that this translation assumes you want to maintain the same functionality as the original Java code. If there are any specific requirements or constraints for your Python implementation (e.g., compatibility with a certain version of Python), please let me know and I'll do my best to accommodate them!
