Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class WrapIModelMethod:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __init__(self, pv_instance):
        super().__init__()

    def call(self, p_context_object, arg_count, pp_arguments, pp_result=None, pp_metadata=None):
        return self._invoke_hr(0x1, None, p_context_object, arg_count, pp_arguments, 
                               pp_result if pp_result is not None else PointerByReference(), 
                               pp_metadata if pp_metadata is not None else PointerByReference())

class PointerByReference:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

class IModelMethod:
    pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `Structure`, `Pointer` and other JNA classes. The above code uses native Python types to represent the same functionality.

Also, there is no direct translation for `ULONGLONG` in Python as it is a 64-bit unsigned integer type which doesn't exist natively in Python. You might need to use an external library or create your own class if you want to work with such data type in Python.

The `_invoke_hr` method and its parameters are not defined here, so I just left them as they were in the Java code for simplicity's sake.
