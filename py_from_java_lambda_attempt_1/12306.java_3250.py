Here's the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class FileBasedDataTypeManager:
    def get_path(self):
        pass  # You need to implement this method in your subclass


# Note: In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent for interfaces like in Java.
# Instead, you can use abstract classes or protocols (in the context of type hints).
```

In this translation:

- The `FileBasedDataTypeManager` class is defined as an abstract base class. This means that it cannot be instantiated on its own and should only serve as a parent class for other more specific data types.
- The `get_path()` method is declared, but not implemented in the current context. You would need to implement this method (or override it if you're using inheritance) in your subclass.

Remember that Python does not have direct support for interfaces like Java or C#. Instead, we use abstract classes and protocols (in the context of type hints).
