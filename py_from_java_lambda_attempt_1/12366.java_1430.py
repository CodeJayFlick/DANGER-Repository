Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class Pointer48DataType:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__init__()

    @classmethod
    def __init__.cls(cls):
        ClassTranslator.put("ghidra.program.model.data.Pointer48", cls.__name__)

    dataType = staticmethod(Pointer48DataType())

def main():
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `public`, `static` and other access modifiers. Also, Python does not support the concept of a "factory" in the same way as Java.
