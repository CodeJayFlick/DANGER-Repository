Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class InVmModelForDbgmodelBreakpointsTest:
    def get_break_pattern(self):
        return PathPattern("Sessions[0x0].Processes[].Debug.Breakpoints[]")

    def model_host(self) -> 'InVmDbgmodelModelHost':
        try:
            from . import InVmDbgmodelModelHost
            return InVmDbgmodelModelHost()
        except ImportError as e:
            raise TypeError(f"Failed to load {e}")
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `@Override` annotation. The method overriding is done by name and parameter signature, which means the same named methods with matching parameters are considered overridden.

Also, Python has no concept of checked exceptions like Java's `throws Throwable`. Instead, you can use a try-except block to catch any exception that might be raised during execution.
