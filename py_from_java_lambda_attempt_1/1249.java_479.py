Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class InVmModelForDbgmodelScenarioCloneExitTest:
    def model_host(self):
        return InVmDbgmodelModelHost()

class AbstractModelForDbgengScenarioCloneExitTest:
    pass

class InVmDbgmodelModelHost:
    pass
```
Note that I did not translate the Java imports, as Python does not have a direct equivalent. Instead, you would need to import any necessary modules or classes separately in your Python code.

Also, note that this translation is purely mechanical and may not be perfect - for example, some Java features like annotations (`@Override`) do not have direct equivalents in Python.
