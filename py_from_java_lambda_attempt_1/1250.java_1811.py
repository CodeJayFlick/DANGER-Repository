Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class InVmModelForDbgmodelScenarioForkExitTest:
    def test_scenario(self):
        pass  # No implementation for this method in the original Java code.

    def model_host(self):
        return InVmDbgmodelModelHost()
```

Note that I've removed the `@Ignore` and `@Test` annotations, as they are specific to JUnit testing frameworks.
