Here is a translation of the provided Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class InVmModelForDbgmodelScenarioMemoryTest:
    def model_host(self):
        return InVmDbgmodelModelHost()

    def get_address_to_write(self, process: 'TargetProcess') -> Address:
        module_path = PathUtils.extend(process.get_path(), ['Modules'])
        modules = m.find_all(TargetModule, module_path, True)
        values = list(modules.values())
        test_module = TargetModule(values[0])
        range_ = test_module.fetch_attribute('RANGE_ATTRIBUTE_NAME').get()
        return Address(range_.min_address().add(0x15000))

class InVmDbgmodelModelHost:
    pass

from ghidra.dbg.target import TargetProcess, TargetModule
from ghidra.program.model.address import AddressRange, Address
import PathUtils
```

Please note that this translation is not a direct conversion from Java to Python. It's more of an equivalent implementation in Python. The `PathUtils` and other classes might need additional imports or modifications based on the actual usage within your project.

Also, please be aware that you would likely need to have some sort of bridge or interface between these Ghidra-specific classes and their equivalents in Java if you're trying to integrate this code with a larger system.
