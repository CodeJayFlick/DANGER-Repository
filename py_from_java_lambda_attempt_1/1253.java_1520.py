Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class InVmModelForDbgmodelScenarioX64RegistersTest:
    def model_host(self):
        return InVmDbgmodelModelHost()

# Define a class for ModelHost
class InVmDbgmodelModelHost:
    pass

```

Please note that this translation is not exact, as Python and Java are different languages with their own syntax. This code may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your project.
