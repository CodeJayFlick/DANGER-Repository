Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from collections import Iterable, Iterator

class FunctionIterator(Iterable):
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    # Implementing iterator protocol (next() method)
    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this!")

# Note: Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's Iterator interface.
```

Note that the `Function` class is missing in your provided code, so I didn't include it here. Also, since there are no specific methods or properties defined for `FunctionIterator`, only a basic implementation as per the iterator protocol has been given.
