Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
from collections import Iterable, Iterator

class InstructionIterator(Iterable['Instruction'], Iterator['Instruction']):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def hasNext(self) -> bool:
        # TO DO: implement this method
        return False  # placeholder for now

    def next(self) -> 'Instruction':
        # TO DO: implement this method
        raise NotImplementedError("next() must be implemented")
```

Note that in Python, we don't need to explicitly define the methods `__init__`, `hasNext` and `next`. However, I have included them here for completeness. The actual implementation of these methods would depend on how you want your iterator to behave.

Also note that Python does not support operator overloading like Java's @Override annotation.
