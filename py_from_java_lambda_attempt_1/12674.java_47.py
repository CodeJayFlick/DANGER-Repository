class DynamicReference:
    """<code>DynamicReference</code> is a dynamically determined reference which 
       may not be explicitly added, deleted or modified"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        pass

```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `interface` and `extends`. In the given translation, I've used Python classes to represent the interface.
