Here's your requested translation:

```Python
class ExternalLocationIterator:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def hasNext(self) -> bool:
        # Your implementation here
        return True  # Replace with actual logic

    def next(self) -> 'ExternalLocation':
        # Your implementation here
        raise StopIteration  # Replace with actual logic


class ExternalLocation:
    pass
```

Please note that you'll need to implement the `hasNext` and `next` methods according to your specific requirements.
