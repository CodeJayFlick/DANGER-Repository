Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
from collections import Collection

class LanguageTranslatorFactoryMinion:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_language_translators(self) -> 'Collection[LanguageTranslator]':
        # Implement your logic here to return a collection of language translators
        pass


# Example usage:
def main():
    minion = LanguageTranslatorFactoryMinion()
    print(minion.get_language_translators())  # Replace this with actual implementation

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Please note that Python does not have an exact equivalent to Java's interface concept. Instead, we can use abstract classes or protocols (in the context of type hints) to achieve similar functionality.
