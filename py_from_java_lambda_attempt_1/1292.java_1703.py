Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class GdbLibraryLoadedEvent:
    def __init__(self, tail):
        super().__init__(tail)
```

Note that this Python class does not include any error handling for parsing errors as it was present in the original Java code. Also, there is no direct translation of `CharSequence` to a built-in Python type because Python doesn't have an equivalent concept like Java's CharSequence (which can be either String or StringBuilder).
