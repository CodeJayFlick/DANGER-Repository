Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class GdbLibraryUnloadedEvent:
    def __init__(self, tail):
        super().__init__(tail)

# This class doesn't exist in the original code but I assume it's an abstract base class for all GDB library events.
class AbstractGdbLibraryEvent:
    def __init__(self, tail):
        pass

from agent.gdb.manager.parsing import GdbParseError  # Assuming this is a Python module with the equivalent of Java's GdbParseError.

# The original code doesn't specify what these classes are or how they're used. I'm just providing them as an example.
class Agent:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    class GdbManager:
        def __init__(self):
            pass

        class ParsingUtils:
            def __init__(self):
                pass
```

Please note that this is a direct translation of the Java code into Python. The actual usage and implementation details may vary depending on your specific requirements.
