Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class ResourceFileFilter:
    def __call__(self, file):
        return True  # Replace with your implementation
```
Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's `public interface` or `accept()` method. Instead, we define a class with a single method (`__call__`) that takes an argument and returns a boolean value.

In this example, I've left the implementation of the `accept()` method blank, as it depends on your specific requirements. You can replace the `return True` statement with your own logic to filter resource files based on their properties or contents.
