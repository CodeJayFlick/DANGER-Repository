Here is the translation of the Java interface `GhidraLaunchable` into a Python class:

```python
class GhidraLaunchable:
    def launch(self, layout: 'GhidraApplicationLayout', args: list) -> None:
        """Launches the launchable.

        Args:
            layout (GhidraApplicationLayout): The application layout to use for the launch.
            args (list[str]): The arguments passed through by GhidraLauncher.

        Raises:
            Exception: If there was a problem with the launch.
        """
        pass
```

Note that I've used type hints and docstrings in Python, which are similar to Java's annotations. However, keep in mind that Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need explicit types for variables or method parameters like you do in Java.

Also, since `GhidraApplicationLayout` is not defined in the original code snippet, I've left it as a placeholder type hint. You would replace this with an actual class definition if needed.
