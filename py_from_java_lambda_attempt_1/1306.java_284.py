Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

class GdbCause:
    class Causes(Enum):
        UNCLAIMED = ""

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass
```

Note: Python does not have direct equivalent to Java's `public interface` or `enum`. In Python, we can achieve similar functionality using classes and enums.

Here is the explanation of how I translated each part:

1. The comment block at the top remains as it was in Java.
2. The class definition for GdbCause: This translates directly into a Python class with no changes needed.
3. The enum definition inside GdbCause: In Python, we use an Enum from the `enum` module to achieve similar functionality.
