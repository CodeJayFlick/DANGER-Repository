Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class ConstantValueAttribute:
    def __init__(self):
        self.constant_value_index = None

    def read_from_binary_reader(self, reader):
        super().__init__()
        self.constant_value_index = reader.read_next_short()

    @property
    def constant_value_index(self):
        return self._constant_value_index & 0xffff

    def to_data_type(self) -> dict:
        structure = {"ConstantValue_attribute": {}}
        structure["ConstantValue_attribute"]["constantvalue_index"] = None
        return structure


class BinaryReader:
    @staticmethod
    def read_next_short():
        # implement your binary reader logic here
        pass

```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `u2` and `u4`, which are used to represent unsigned short and unsigned int respectively. In the above code, I've represented them as integers in Python.

Also, Python doesn't support exact equivalent of Java's constant pool table. So, we can just store the index value for now.
