Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AbstractConstantPoolReferenceInfo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.class_index = None
        self.name_and_type_index = None

    def read_from_binary_reader(self, reader):
        super().__init__()
        self.class_index = reader.read_short()
        self.name_and_type_index = reader.read_short()

    @property
    def class_index(self):
        return self.class_index & 0xffff

    @property
    def name_and_type_index(self):
        return self.name_and_type_index & 0xffff

    def to_data_type(self) -> tuple:
        name = "unnamed"
        structure = {"tag": None, "class_ index": self.class_index, "name and type index": self.name_and_type_index}
        return ("unnamed", structure)
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `abstract` classes or methods. Also, the concept of a `BinaryReader` is not directly translatable to Python as it seems to be specific to Java. The equivalent in Python would likely involve reading from a file-like object using standard I/O operations.

Additionally, the `toDataType()` method has been modified slightly to return a tuple instead of an instance of `StructureDataType`, which does not have a direct equivalent in Python.
