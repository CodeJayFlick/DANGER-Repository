Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class ConstantPoolClassInfo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name_index = None

    def from_reader(self, reader):
        if not isinstance(reader, object):  # assuming BinaryReader in your case
            raise TypeError("reader must be an instance of BinaryReader")
        try:
            super().__init__()
            self.name_index = reader.read_next_short()
        except Exception as e:  # assuming IOException and other exceptions
            print(f"An error occurred while reading the file. {str(e)}")

    def get_name_index(self):
        return self.name_index & 0xffff

class DataType:
    pass

def to_data_type(self, name="CONSTANT_Class_info"):
    structure = {"tag": "BYTE", "name_index": "WORD"}
    return structure
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `abstract class` and `interface`. In the given code, I've used a simple class to represent the abstract concept. Also, in Python, we don't need to specify the type of variables while declaring them.

Also, please note that this is just an approximation of how you could translate your Java code into Python. It's not perfect and might require some adjustments based on specific requirements or constraints.
