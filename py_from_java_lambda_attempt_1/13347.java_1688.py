Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import unittest

class PPC64_O3_EmulatorTest:
    LANGUAGE_ID = "PowerPC:BE:64:default"
    COMPILER_SPEC_ID = "default"

    REG_DUMP_SET = []

    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name, self.LANGUAGE_ID, self.COMPILER_SPEC_ID, self.REG_DUMP_SET)

    @property
    def processor_designator(self):
        return "powerpc64_GCC_O3"

def suite():
    return unittest.makeSuite(PPC64_O3_EmulatorTest)
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `@Override` annotation. The `processor_designator` method is declared as a property (using the `@property` decorator) to mimic the getter behavior in Java.

Also, Python does not support static methods and variables like Java. So we are using class-level attributes instead.
