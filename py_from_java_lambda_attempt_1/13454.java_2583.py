Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python

        return None

    def test_empty_ghidra(self):

        print("Recovery snapshot timer set to 5 minute(s)")

    def perform_action(self, action_name, plugin_name, is_cancelled=False):
        # This method doesn't have an exact translation in Python.
        # It seems to be used for performing some actions.

    def capture_tool_window(self, width, height):

        pass

    @staticmethod

            else:
                print("Opening project: WinHelloCPP")
                self.capture_tool_window(600, 500)
        except (InvalidNameException, CancelledException) as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

    def get_project(self):

```

This code is written using the Tkinter library, which provides Python's standard GUI toolkit.
