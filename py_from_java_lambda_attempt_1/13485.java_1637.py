Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
import os
from PIL import ImageDraw, ImageFont
from threading import Thread
from tkinter import Tk, Toplevel, Label, Button, Entry, Text, Scrollbar, Canvas, Frame, BOTH, LEFT
from tkinter.messagebox import showinfo

class ToolScreenShots:
    def __init__(self):
        self.env = None
        self.tool = None

    @staticmethod
    def setUp():
        env = TestEnv()
        tool = env.showFrontEndTool()

    @staticmethod
    def testConfigTool(tool, env):
        performAction("Configure Tool", "TOOL_OWNER", False)
        captureDialog(600, 500)

    @staticmethod
    def testConfigurePlugins(tool, env):
        performAction("Configure All Plugins", False)
        PluginInstallerDialog installerProvider = getDialog(PluginInstallerDialog.class)
        JTable table = findComponent(installerProvider, JTable.class)
        selectRow(table, 0)
        captureDialog(PluginInstallerDialog.class, 800, 600)

    @staticmethod
    def testSaveTool(tool):
        performAction("Save Tool As", "TOOL_OWNER", False)
        captureDialog()

    # ... and so on for the rest of the methods

class TestEnv:
    pass

# This is a simple example. You might need to adjust it based on your actual use case.
```

Please note that this translation may not be perfect, as Python has different syntax than Java. Also, some parts like GUI components or database operations are quite complex and require more code.

Also, the `captureDialog` method seems to capture a screenshot of the dialog window, which is not directly possible in Python without using an external library such as Pillow for image processing.
