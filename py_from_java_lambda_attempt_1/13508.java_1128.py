Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# No license information or copyright notice needed for this Python script.

import unittest

class CopyPasteTestSuite(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_clipboard_plugin(self):
        pass  # Add your tests here.
    
    #def test_byte_viewer_clipboard_provider(self):  # Un-comment to run in IDE. This can also be uncommented if the integration test module is updated to have a dependency on every module's test classes as well as source code.
    #def test_code_browser_clipboard_provider(self):
    #def test_copy_paste_comments(self):
    #def test_copy_paste_function_info(self):

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note: Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `@RunWith` and `@SuiteClasses`. The above code is just an example of how you might structure your tests in Python.
