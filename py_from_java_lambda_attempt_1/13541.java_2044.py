Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This comment block has been removed as it's not a valid part of the Python code.

class DiamondServiceC:
    pass  # No implementation for this interface.
```

Note: In Python, we don't have direct equivalents to Java interfaces or annotations like `@ServiceInfo`. The given Java code is essentially defining an empty interface with some metadata.
