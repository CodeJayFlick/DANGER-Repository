Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
# No license information or copyright notices are included in this Python version.

class GhidraRootPreferenceInitializer:
    def initialize_default_preferences(self):
        store = Activator().get_preference_store()
        store.set_default('GHIDRA_REQUESTED_OPEN_PORT_CONSENT', False)
```
Note that I did not include any Java-specific constructs like packages, imports, or annotations in the Python version. The `Activator` and `IPreferenceStore` classes are likely specific to the Eclipse/Java environment and do not have direct equivalents in Python.

In this translation:

* The class is defined using the standard Python syntax.
* The `initialize_default_preferences` method replaces the Java equivalent, with a similar signature (no return value).
* The `store.set_default()` call sets the default value for a preference. In Python, we don't need to specify types or use getters/setters like in Java.

Keep in mind that this is just an approximation of the original code and may not be exactly equivalent due to differences between languages.
