Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class BTreeHeaderRecordAttributes:
    BT_BAD_CLOSE_MASK = 0x00000001
    BT_BIG_KEYS_MASK = 0x00000002
    BT_VARIABLE_INDEX_KEYS_MASK = 0x00000004
```

Note that in Python, we don't need to specify the `public` or `final` keywords as they are not applicable. Also, Python doesn't have a direct equivalent of Java's package declaration at the top level; however, you can use modules and classes to organize your code similarly.
