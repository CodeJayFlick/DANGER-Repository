Here's your Java code translated into Python:

```Python
class OrcKing:
    """Orc King."""
    
    description = "This is the orc king!"

    def get_description(self):
        return self.description


# Usage example:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    orcking = OrcKing()
    print(orcking.get_description())
```

Note that Python doesn't have direct equivalent of Java's `package` statement. In Python, you can use modules to organize your code into logical groups.
