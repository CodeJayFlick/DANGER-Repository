Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python

class ProductInformationClient:
    """Interface for the Information micro-service."""

    def get_product_title(self):
        pass
```

Note that in this translation, I have not implemented any actual functionality. Instead, I've created a Python class `ProductInformationClient` with one method `get_product_title`. This is because interfaces in Java are essentially abstract classes without implementation and can only be used to define the contract for implementing classes or objects.
