Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python code:

import springboot as sb

class App:
    """API Gateway pattern implementation for an e-commerce site."""

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @sbBootApplication
    def main(self, args):
        sb.run(App, args)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = App()
    app.main(sys.argv[1:])
```

Please note that this is a direct translation of the Java code into Python. The equivalent functionality in Python might be different from what you would expect if you were writing it directly in Python.

Here are some key differences:

- In Python, we don't need to declare types for variables or method parameters.
- We use `@` notation for decorators (like `@sbBootApplication`) and functions with specific behaviors (like `@classmethod`, `@staticmethod`, etc.).
- The equivalent of Java's `public static void main(String[] args)` is simply `def main(self, args):`.
- Python uses indentation to denote block-level structure instead of curly braces.
- We don't need a separate class for the entry point; we can define it directly in the script.

The above code does not include any actual implementation of an API Gateway pattern. It only translates the provided Java code into equivalent Python syntax.
