Here is the equivalent Python code:

import os

class PriceApplication:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

def main():
    print("Price microservice started")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note that this Python code does not have direct equivalent to the Java Spring Boot application. The original Java code is using Spring Boot framework, which provides a lot of features such as auto-configuration and dependency injection. In Python, you would typically use Flask or Django for building web applications, but these frameworks are quite different from Spring Boot.

If you want to create a simple command-line application in Python that can be run with `python price_app.py`, the above code is one way to do it. However, if you need more complex features like auto-configuration and dependency injection, you might consider using a framework like Flask or Django.
