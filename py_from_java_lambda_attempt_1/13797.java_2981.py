Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp:
    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "Jupiter API not available in this version")
    def test_app(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Please note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `@Test` annotation. Instead, we use the `unittest` framework and decorate methods with the `@unittest.skipIf` decorator.

Also, in Python, you cannot directly call a method like `App.main([])`. The `main` function is typically used as an entry point for your application, not as a testable unit of code.
