Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
class VirtualMachine:
    def __init__(self, wizard1, wizard2):
        self.wizard1 = wizard1
        self.wizard2 = wizard2

    def execute(self, bytecode):
        pass  # This method should be implemented based on the provided bytecode


class Wizard:
    def __init__(self, health, agility, wisdom, attack, defense):
        self.health = health
        self.agility = agility
        self.wisdom = wisdom
        self.attack = attack
        self.defense = defense

LITERAL_0 = "LITERAL 0"
HEALTH_PATTERN = "%s_HEALTH"
GET_AGILITY = "GET_AGILITY"
GET_WISDOM = "GET_WISDOM"
ADD = "ADD"
LITERAL_2 = "LITERAL 2"
DIVIDE = "DIVIDE"


def main():
    vm = VirtualMachine(Wizard(45, 7, 11, 0, 0), Wizard(36, 18, 8, 0, 0))

    bytecode_list = [
        LITERAL_0,
        LITERAL_0,
        HEALTH_PATTERN % "GET",
        LITERAL_0,
        GET_AGILITY,
        LITERAL_0,
        GET_WISDOM,
        ADD,
        LITERAL_2,
        DIVIDE,
        ADD,
        HEALTH_PATTERN % "SET"
    ]

    for bytecode in bytecode_list:
        vm.execute(InstructionConverterUtil.convert_to_bytecode(bytecode))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note that the `Slf4j` annotation is not directly translatable to Python, as it's a Java-specific logging mechanism. In Python, you would typically use a library like `logging` or `loguru`.
