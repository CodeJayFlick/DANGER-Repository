Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class AdvancedSorceress:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tobacco = None

    def smoke(self):
        if self.tobacco is not None:
            self.tobacco.smoke(self)
```

Note that in this Python version, we do not have a direct equivalent of Java's `@Setter` annotation. Instead, the attribute can be set directly through its name:

```Python
sorceress = AdvancedSorceress()
sorceress.tobacco = some_tobacco_object  # Set tobacco object using setter method.
```

In this Python version, we also do not have a direct equivalent of Java's `implements Wizard` statement. Instead, the class can be treated as implementing any desired interface or protocol by defining methods with matching names and signatures:

```Python
class Wizard:
    def smoke(self):
        pass

sorceress = AdvancedSorceress()
sorceress.smoke()  # This method will call tobacco's smoke method.
```

The `Tobacco` class is not provided in the given Java code, so I assume it exists elsewhere and provides a `smoke(Wizard)` method.
