Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "Requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that the original Java code was a JUnit test, and this Python version is also using the `unittest` module to write tests. The main difference between the two codes is how they handle exceptions: in Java, you can use `assertDoesNotThrow()` from Jupiter API to ensure an exception does not occur; in Python, we're catching the SystemExit exception that's raised when running the App.main() method and asserting its code equals 0.

Also note that this test will only run if your Python version is 3.7 or higher because of `@unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "Requires Python 3.7 or higher")`.
