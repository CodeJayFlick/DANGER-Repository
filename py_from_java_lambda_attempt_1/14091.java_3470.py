Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest

class TestApp:
    def test_should_execute_application_without_exception(self):
        try:
            App.main([])
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Exception occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that the equivalent of Java's `@Test` annotation is Python's `unittest` framework, which requires a test class to inherit from `unittest.TestCase`. The test method itself should start with the prefix `test_`, and it can use various assertion methods provided by the `self` object.
