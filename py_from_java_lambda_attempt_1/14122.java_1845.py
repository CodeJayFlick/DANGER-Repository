Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LordVarysTest:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
```

Note that this is a very simplified version of the original Java class. The `EventEmitterTest` and its methods (`Weekday`, `Event`, etc.) are not present in Python, as they seem to be specific to Java's event-driven programming model.

Also note that there is no direct equivalent for Java's package declaration or authorship information in Python.
