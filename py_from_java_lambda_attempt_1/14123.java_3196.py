Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class ScoutTest:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(Weekday.TUESDAY, Event.WARSHIPS_APPROACHING, lambda: Scout(), lambda: Scout())

# Assuming you have classes Weekday and Event defined elsewhere in your program,
# or import them from a library. If not, replace these with whatever types they are.

class EventEmitterTest:
    def __init__(self, day, event_type, factory1, factory2):
        pass  # This class is missing its implementation
```

Note that the `EventEmitterTest` class seems to be missing some functionality from the original Java code. The equivalent Python would likely involve using a library like asyncio or even just plain old threading for handling events and their related objects in an event-driven manner, but without more context about what this test is supposed to do, it's hard to provide a complete translation.

Also note that Python does not have direct equivalents of Java classes such as `package`, `@author`, etc. These are specific to the Java language itself.
