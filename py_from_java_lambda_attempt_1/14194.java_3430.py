Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "Jupiter API not available in this version")
    def test_app_execution(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Please note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `@Test` annotation. Instead, we use the built-in testing framework called `unittest`. The test function is decorated with the `@unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "Jupiter API not available in this version")` decorator which skips the test if Python version is less than 3.7.

The original Java code uses JUnit Jupiter for assertions and to mark tests as expected exceptions. In Python's unittest framework, we use `self.assertRaises()` method to assert that a certain exception was raised during the execution of the tested function.
