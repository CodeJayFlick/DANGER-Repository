Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

import threading

class HolderThreadSafe:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_heavy(self) -> 'Heavy':
        # This method is not implemented in the original Java code, so I'll leave it as a placeholder.
        raise NotImplementedError("get_heavy() must be implemented")

class Heavy:
    pass  # This class is also not defined in the original Java code, so I'll just leave it as an abstract placeholder.

class HolderThreadSafeTest:
    def __init__(self):
        self.holder = HolderThreadSafe()

    def get_internal_heavy_value(self) -> 'Heavy':
        holder_field = type(HolderThreadSafe).getattribute("heavy")
        return getattr(self.holder, "heavy")

    def get_heavy(self) -> 'Heavy':
        return self.holder.get_heavy()
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the `Heavy` class and its methods, as they were not defined in the original Java code. In a real-world implementation, you would need to define these classes and their methods accordingly.

Also, Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `@Override`, `final`, or `throws Exception`. I've omitted those annotations from the translation.
