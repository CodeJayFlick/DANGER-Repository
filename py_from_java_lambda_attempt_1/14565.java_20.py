Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import unittest
from io import FileNotFoundError

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_should_execute_without_exception(self):
        try:
            App.main()
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Exception occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `@Test` annotation. Instead, we define test methods using the name of the method starting with "test". The `unittest.TestCase` class provides various assertion methods like `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, etc., which can be used in these test methods.

Also note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `Executable` interface or its usage. Instead, we simply call the `App.main()` method and catch any exceptions that may occur during execution.
