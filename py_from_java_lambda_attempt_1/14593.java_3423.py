Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "This test requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0
```

Note that the `App` class and its `main` method are not defined in this code, so you would need to define them elsewhere in your Python program. The Java code is using JUnit Jupiter for testing, which does not have a direct equivalent in Python's unittest module.
