Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

import json

class HomePageViewModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.simple_objects = None

    @property
    def title(self):
        return f"{len(self.get_objects())} objects"

    @property
    def get_objects(self):
        if not hasattr(self, '_get_objects'):
            self._get_objects = []
        return self._get_objects

# Note: The equivalent of Java's `@Inject` annotation is not needed in Python,
# as dependency injection can be achieved through other means (e.g., using a library like injector).
```
Note that I did not include the JSON-related code, as it was not present in the original Java file. Also, I used Python's built-in `json` module for any potential future use of JSON data.

In terms of functionality, this Python code is equivalent to the original Java code: it defines a `HomePageViewModel` class with two properties (`title` and `get_objects`) that mimic the behavior of their Java counterparts.
