Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

import pytest

class CatalogOfFixturesGlue:
    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
    def integration_fixtures(self):
        yield from RecreateSimpleObjects().install()

def recreate_simple_objects():
    # implement the logic to install and return a fixture of SimpleObjects
    pass
```
Note that I've used `pytest` as the testing framework, since it's commonly used in Python. The `@fixture(autouse=True)` decorator is equivalent to the Java annotation `@Before`, but with some differences:

* In Python, we don't need to specify a value or order for the fixture.
* We use `yield from` instead of calling a method and returning its result.

The rest of the code remains similar: defining a class `CatalogOfFixturesGlue` that contains a single method `integration_fixtures`, which installs a fixture using the `RecreateSimpleObjects()` object.
