Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "This test requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app_execution(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that the original Java code is a JUnit test, and Python's built-in `unittest` module provides similar functionality. However, there are some differences in how exceptions are handled between Java and Python.

In particular, the `assertDoesNotThrow` method from Java does not have an exact equivalent in Python. Instead, we use the `with self.assertRaises()` context manager to catch any exception that might be raised by calling `App.main([])`. We then assert that the caught exception is a `SystemExit` object with code 0, which indicates successful execution of the application.

Also note that I've used the `@unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "This test requires Python 3.7 or higher")` decorator to skip this test if the running Python version is less than 3.7. This is because the original Java code uses JUnit Jupiter API which was introduced in Java 11 and has no direct equivalent in Python before 3.7.
