Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
class Gobbit:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

class GHobbitsTest:
    def data_provider(self):
        return [
            {"weather": "SUNNY", "response": "The hobbits are facing Sunny weather now"},
            {"weather": "RAINY", "response": "The hobbits are facing Rainy weather now"},
            {"weather": "WINDY", "response": "The hobbits are facing Windy weather now"},
            {"weather": "COLD", "response": "The hobbits are facing Cold weather now"}
        ]

    def __init__(self):
        pass

# Example usage:
test = GHobbitsTest()
print(test.data_provider())
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `package`, `import` statements, or the concept of classes extending other classes. Also, Python is dynamically typed and does not require explicit type definitions for variables like in Java.
