Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import unittest

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_app(self):
        try:
            App.main([])
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Exception occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
Note that I've used the `unittest` module in Python, which is similar to JUnit in Java. The test class inherits from `TestCase`, and each test method starts with the prefix `test_`. In this case, we have a single test method called `test_app`.

The test method attempts to execute the `App.main()` function with an empty array as input. If any exception occurs during execution, it will be caught by the `try`-`except` block and the test will fail.

Finally, I've used the `unittest.main()` call at the end of the script to run all tests in the module when executed directly (i.e., not imported as a package).
