Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "This test requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app_execution(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0
```

Please note that the original Java code was a JUnit test for an application named `App`. The provided translation is also a Python unit test, but it's not exactly equivalent to the original.
