Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "Jupiter API not available in this version")
    def test_app_execution(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `@Test` annotation. Instead, we use the built-in unittest module and its TestCase class to define our test cases.

Also note that in order for this code to work correctly, you would need to replace App with your actual application object or function.
