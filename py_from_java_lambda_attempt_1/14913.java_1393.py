Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
class SpellbookDAO:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def find_by_name(self, name: str) -> 'Spellbook':
        # implement your logic here
        return None  # or some default value if not found


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Dao(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get Spellbook(self) -> 'Spellbook':
        pass


class Spellbook:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface and class. However, we can achieve similar functionality using abstract classes or interfaces from the abc module in Python.

In this translation:

- The `SpellbookDAO` is a regular Python class.
- The `Dao` is an abstract base class (ABC) with one abstract method (`get Spellbook`). This ABC represents the interface that any concrete implementation of `SpellbookDAO` must adhere to.
