import unittest

class InVmModelForGdbScenarioCloneExitTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_model_host(self):
        from agent.gdb.model import InVmGdbModelHost
        self.assertEqual(InVmGdbModelHost().modelHost(), "In-Vm GDB Model Host")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
Note that I did not include the `NightlyCategory` or `AbstractModelForGdbScenarioCloneExitTest` classes, as they are specific to Java and do not have direct equivalents in Python. The test case is written using the built-in `unittest` module in Python.

Also, please note that this translation assumes a basic understanding of both Java and Python programming languages. If you need further assistance or clarification on any part of the code, feel free to ask!
