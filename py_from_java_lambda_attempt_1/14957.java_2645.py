Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class ThreadSafeLazyLoadedIvoryTowerTest:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

# No equivalent for this part in Python as it's a license notice.
```

Note that there are some significant differences between Java and Python. For example, the concept of classes is similar but not identical (Python has no explicit `public` or `private`, everything is public by default), and methods are defined using indentation rather than curly braces.
