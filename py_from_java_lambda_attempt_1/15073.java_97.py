Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
class SubtleMethodTest:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            SubtleMethod(),
            "shop keeper",
            f"The target has been chosen as { 'shop keeper' }.",
            "Approach the shop keeper with tears running and hug him!",
            "While in close contact grab the shop keeper's wallet."
        )

class StealingMethodTest:
    def __init__(self, method):
        pass

class SubtleMethod:
    pass
```

Please note that this is a direct translation of your Java code to Python. However, it might not be exactly what you want because there are some differences between the two languages. For example:

- In Python, we don't need `public` or `private` keywords for variables and methods.
- We use `class` keyword instead of `package`.
- The constructor in Java is a special method called `__init__()` in Python.
- String concatenation works differently between the two languages.
