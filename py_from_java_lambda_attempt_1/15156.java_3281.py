Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "This test requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app_execution(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0
```

Note that the `App` class and its `main` method are not defined in this code, so you would need to replace them with your actual application's entry point.
