Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
from typing import List

class ExchangeRateDao:
    def insert_or_update(self, exchange_rate_entry: dict) -> None:
        # Replace with your database insertion logic
        pass

    def find_all(self) -> List[dict]:
        # Replace with your database query logic
        return []

    def find_by_constraint(self, constraint: str) -> List[dict]:
        # Replace with your database query logic
        return []

    def find_by_currency_code(self, currency_code: str) -> dict:
        # Replace with your database query logic
        return {}
```
Note that this is a direct translation of the Java code to Python, without considering any specific database library or ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). In Python, you would typically use a library like SQLAlchemy or pandas to interact with databases.

Also, I replaced the `LiveData` type from Android's Room persistence library with a simple list in Python. If you need to implement similar functionality for reactive programming, you may want to consider using libraries like RxPy or asyncio.
