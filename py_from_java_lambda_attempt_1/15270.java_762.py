Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class RequestCoinsActivityViewModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.show_help_dialog = None  # equivalent to MutableLiveData in Java

# Note: This is a simplified version as there's no direct equivalent for LiveData and ViewModel in Python.
```

This Python class `RequestCoinsActivityViewModel` has an attribute `show_help_dialog`. In the original Java code, this was implemented using `MutableLiveData`, which seems to be specific to Android development.
