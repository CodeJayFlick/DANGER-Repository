Here is a translation of your Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class CustomDefaultTimeBar:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scrubber_bar = None
        self.scrubbing = False
        self.scrubbing_start_x = 0

    def onTouchEvent(self, event):
        if event.get_action() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN and self.scrubber_bar is not None:
            self.scrubbing = False
            self.scrubbing_start_x = int(event.get_x())
            distance_from_scrubber = abs(int(self.scrubber_bar.right) - self.scrubbing_start_x)
            if distance_from_scrubber > 24: 
                return True
            else:
                self.scrubbing = True

        elif not self.scrubbing and event.get_action() == MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE and self.scrubber_bar is not None:
            distance_from_start = abs(int(event.get_x()) - self.scrubbing_start_x)
            if distance_from_start > 6: 
                self.scrubbing = True
                try:
                    method = DefaultTimeBar.startScrubbing(0) # equivalent to Java's invoke() method
                except Exception as e:
                    print(e)

            else:
                return True

        return super.onTouchEvent(event)
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents for some of the Java classes and methods used in your code. For example, `MotionEvent` is a class from Android's API which doesn't exist in standard Python. Also, `Rect`, `Field`, `Method`, etc are all part of Java's reflection system, but there isn't an exact equivalent in Python.

This translation assumes that you have the necessary classes and methods available for use (like `MotionEvent`), or can be replaced with something similar if they don't exist.
