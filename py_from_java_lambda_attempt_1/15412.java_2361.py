Here is the translation of the Java interface `BoundingBox` into a Python class:

```Python
from shapely.geometry import Polygon, Point

class BoundingBox:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_bounds(self) -> tuple:
        # TO DO: implement this method to return the bounding box coordinates as a tuple of (x1, y1, x2, y2)
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def get_path(self) -> list:
        # TO DO: implement this method to return an iterable object that iterates along the BoundingBox boundary
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def get_point(self) -> Point:
        # TO DO: implement this method to return the top left point of the bounding box as a shapely.geometry.Point object
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def get_iou(self, other_bbox: 'BoundingBox') -> float:
        # TO DO: implement this method to calculate and return the Intersection over Union (IoU) value between two BoundingBox objects
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")
```

Note that I've used Python's type hints for the methods' return types. Also, some parts of the code are left as `TO DO` because they require actual implementation based on your specific requirements and use cases.

As a side note, in Java, you would typically create an abstract class or interface to define common behavior among different classes that implement it. In Python, we don't have direct equivalents for these concepts, but we can achieve similar results using abstract base classes (ABCs) from the `abc` module and/or interfaces implemented through duck typing.
