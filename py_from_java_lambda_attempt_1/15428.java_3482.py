Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import numpy as np
from djl.translate import Transform
from ai.djl.ndarray import NDArray

class RandomFlipTopBottom(Transform):
    def transform(self, array: NDArray) -> NDArray:
        return ndimage.random_flip_top_bottom(array)
```
Note that I assumed the existence of a `ndimage` module with a `random_flip_top_bottom` function, which is not part of the standard Python library. You may need to install an additional package (e.g., OpenCV or scikit-image) to use this functionality.

Also, keep in mind that this translation assumes that the Java code is using some sort of deep learning framework (DJI-Lite?) and its corresponding libraries. The equivalent Python code would likely involve similar dependencies.
