I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language-specific file of code, but rather a copyright notice, license information, and package declaration in Java.

Since you asked me to translate it to Python, here's what I can do:

**No translation needed**

The above code is not actual code written in any programming language. It appears to be boilerplate text that accompanies open-source software or libraries. Therefore, there is no need to translate this code into Python or any other language.

If you meant to provide a different file of code (e.g., Java, C++, etc.), please feel free to share it, and I'll do my best to help with the translation!
