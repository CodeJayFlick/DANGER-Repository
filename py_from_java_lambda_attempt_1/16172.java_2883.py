Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import unittest
from ai_djl_translate import DetectedObjects, Classifications

class InstanceSegmentationTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_instance_segmentation(self):
        try:
            result = InstanceSegmentation.predict()
            best = result.best()
            self.assertEqual(best.class_name, "bicycle")
            self.assertTrue(abs(best.probability - 0.9) < 1e-6)
        except (ModelException, TranslateException, IOException) as e:
            raise

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
Note that I used the `unittest` module to define a test case class, and the `assertEqual` and `assertTrue` methods are equivalent to their Java counterparts. The `try-except` block is used to catch any exceptions raised during the execution of the code.

Also, note that some imports (e.g., `ai_djl_translate`) may not be available in your Python environment, as they seem to be specific to a particular AI/ML framework or library. You would need to install and import those libraries separately if you want to use them.
