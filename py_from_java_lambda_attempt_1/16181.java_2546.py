Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import os
from PIL import Image

class StyleTransferTest:
    def test_style_transfer(self):
        image_path = "src/test/resources/mountains.png"
        input_image = Image.open(image_path)
        generated_image = style_transfer(input_image, 'MONET')

        if not generated_image:
            raise Exception("Only works for PyTorch engine.")

        self.assertEqual(generated_image.size[0], input_image.size[0])
        self.assertEqual(generated_image.size[1], input_image.size[1])

def style_transfer(image, artist):
    # This function is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual implementation of StyleTransfer.transfer
    return None

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test = StyleTransferTest()
    try:
        test.test_style_transfer()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

Please note that this Python code is not a direct translation from the Java code. The `style_transfer` function in the provided Java code seems to be calling some other method or class, which has been replaced with a placeholder (`return None`) in this Python version.
