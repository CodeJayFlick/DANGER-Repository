I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language-specific file, but rather a license notice and package declaration for Java.

Since you asked me to "translate" it to Python, I'll assume you want me to provide equivalent information in Python. Here's what I came up with:

```

```

And here's a Python package declaration:

```python
__package__
from ai.djl.integration.tests.model_zoo.classification import *
```

Please note that these are not actual Python code files, but rather equivalent information in Python. If you're looking for help translating Java-specific code to Python, I'd be happy to assist with that as well!
