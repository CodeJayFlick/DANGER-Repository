This code is a bit of an eyesore, but it's the best I could do to illustrate what you're asking for.

The `@` symbol in Java is used to denote that something is annotated with a specific type or annotation. In this case, we have multiple levels of annotations:

* `public`: This indicates that the code is intended to be public.
* `private`: This indicates that the code should not be accessed directly from outside the class.
* `protected`: This indicates that the code can only be accessed by subclasses.
* `default`: This indicates that the code has a default value.

The rest of the annotations are used to specify what type of initializer is being used. For example, `@public` specifies that the initializer should be public, while `@private` specifies that it should not be accessible from outside the class.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
