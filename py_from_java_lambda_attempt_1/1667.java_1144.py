Here is a translation of the Java interface into equivalent Python code:

```Python
import asyncio

class LldbModelTargetMemoryContainer:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    async def get_target_memory(self, region: dict) -> dict:
        # Implement your logic here to return target memory based on the given region.
        pass

    async def read_memory(self, address: int, length: int) -> bytes:
        # Implement your logic here to read memory from the specified address and length.
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        return bytearray(length)

    async def write_memory(self, address: int, data: bytes) -> None:
        # Implement your logic here to write data into the target memory at the given address.
        pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's CompletableFuture and TargetMemory. We are using asyncio library in Python which provides support for writing single-threaded "cooperative" multitasking code, i.e., concurrent programming based on coroutines (subroutines), multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources, and implementing network clients and servers.
