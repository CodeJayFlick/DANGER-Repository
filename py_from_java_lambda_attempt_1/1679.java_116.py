Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class LldbModelTargetRegisterContainerAndBank:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_target_register(self, register):
        # This method should return an instance of 'LldbModelTargetRegister'
        pass
```

Note that this translation is not exact. The original Java interface has several components (methods and interfaces) which are difficult to translate directly into Python. In particular:

- `SBValue` in the Java code seems like a custom class, but it's hard to tell without more context.
- `LldbModelTargetObject`, `TargetRegisterContainer`, and `TargetRegisterBank` seem like they might be other classes or interfaces that would need to be defined elsewhere.

This Python translation is just an approximation of what you could do in Java.
