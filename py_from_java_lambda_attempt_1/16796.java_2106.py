Here is the translation of the Java interface `RowRecordParser` to a Python class:

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar('T')

class RowRecordParser(Generic[T], object):
    def parse(self, row_record: 'org.apache.iotdb.tsfile.read.common.RowRecord', reuse: T) -> T:
        # Your parsing logic here
        pass
```

Note that in Python, we don't need to explicitly define the `parse` method as a part of an interface. Instead, we can simply create a class with a single method named `parse`. The type hinting is done using the `TypeVar` and `Generic` types from the `typing` module.

Also, I've kept the original Java code's comments for reference purposes only. You would need to implement your own parsing logic in the `parse` method.
