Here's a translation of your Java interface into equivalent Python classes:

```Python
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod
import io


class TSRecordConverter(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    @abstractmethod
    def open(self, schema: 'Schema') -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def convert(self, input_data: object, collector) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def close(self) -> None:
        pass


class Schema:
    # This class is not fully implemented as it was in the Java code.
    pass


def open_converter(converter: TSRecordConverter, schema: 'Schema') -> None:
    converter.open(schema)


def convert_data(input_data: object, collector, converter: TSRecordConverter) -> None:
    try:
        converter.convert(input_data, collector)
    except io.IOException as e:
        print(f"Error converting data. {e}")


def close_converter(converter: TSRecordConverter) -> None:
    try:
        converter.close()
    except io.IOException as e:
        print(f"Error closing the converter. {e}")
```

This Python code defines an abstract base class `TSRecordConverter` with three methods (`open`, `convert`, and `close`) that are similar to their Java counterparts. It also includes a simple implementation of the `Schema` class, which is not fully implemented as it was in the original Java code.

The provided functions `open_converter`, `convert_data`, and `close_converter` demonstrate how you can use these classes in your Python program.
