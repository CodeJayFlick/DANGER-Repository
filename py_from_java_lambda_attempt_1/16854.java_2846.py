Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```

class InfluxDBConstant:
    METHOD_NOT_SUPPORTED = "Method not supported."
    PLACE_HOLDER = "PH"
```
Note that I've kept the same variable names and values as in the original Java code, but Python uses lowercase letters for class and function names by convention.
