Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

class ObjectUpdateService:
    """Service for notifying others of object tree state changes."""

    def fire_object_updated(self, object):
        pass  # This method does nothing by default
```

Note that Python doesn't have direct equivalents to Java's `@ServiceInfo` and package declarations. The equivalent in Python would be a class definition with docstrings.

Also note that the `fireObjectUpdated` method is currently doing nothing as there are no implementations provided for it.
