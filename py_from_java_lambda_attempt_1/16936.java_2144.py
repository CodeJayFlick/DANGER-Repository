Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```
class ServerConfigConsistent:
    """ Configurations using this annotation should be the same across all nodes in a cluster."""
    pass
```

Note that there's no direct equivalent for Java annotations like `@Target`, `@Retention` and `@interface` in Python. In Python, we can achieve similar functionality by defining a class or function with specific characteristics.

In this case, I've defined a simple class named `ServerConfigConsistent`. The docstring provides the same description as the original Java annotation.
