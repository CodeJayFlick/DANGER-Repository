Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import typing as t

class ICrossSpaceMergeFileSelector:
    """IMergeFileSelector selects a set of files from given seqFiles and unseqFiles which can be merged
       without exceeding given memory budget.
    """

    def select(self) -> t.List[t.Any]:
        raise NotImplementedError("Must implement the `select` method")

    def get_concurrent_merge_num(self) -> int:
        raise NotImplementedError("Must implement the `get_concurrent_merge_num` method")
```
Note that I used type hints to indicate the types of the methods and variables, as is common in Python. The `t.List[t.Any]` indicates a list of any type (since we don't know what specific types will be returned), and `int` is self-explanatory.

Also note that I didn't translate the Java comments directly; instead, I provided a brief summary of each method's purpose as part of the class docstring.
