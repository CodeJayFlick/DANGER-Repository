Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

class Configuration:
    pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent to Java's `package` and `public interface`. In Python, we can define classes or functions directly without any package declaration. Also, in Python, interfaces are not a built-in concept like they are in Java. Instead, you would typically use abstract base classes (ABCs) for this purpose.
