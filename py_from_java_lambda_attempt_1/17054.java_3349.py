Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python

class Event:
    pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `package` and `public interface`. In Python, we define classes using the `class` keyword, so I've translated the given code into a simple class definition with no methods or attributes.
