Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import os
import logging
from io import BufferedWriter, FileWriter, File


class UpgradeLog:
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    config = IoTDBConfig()  # Assuming this class exists in your environment
    UPGRADE_DIR = "upgrade"
    UPGRADE_LOG_NAME = "upgrade.txt"

    upgrade_log_path = None

    def __init__(self):
        self.upgrade_log_writer = None

    @classmethod
    def create_upgrade_log(cls):
        try:
            if not os.path.exists(os.path.dirname(cls.upgrade_log_path)):
                os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(cls.upgrade_log_path))
            with open(cls.upgrade_log_path, 'w+'):
                pass
            cls.upgrade_log_writer = BufferedWriter(FileWriter(cls.upgrade_log_path, True))
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            cls.logger.error("meet error when create upgrade log, file path:{}", cls.upgrade_log_path)
            return False

    @classmethod
    def get_upgrade_log_path(cls):
        return cls.upgrade_log_path

    @classmethod
    def write_upgrade_log_file(cls, content):
        try:
            with UpgradeLog().upgrade_log_writer as writer:
                writer.write(content + '\n')
                writer.flush()
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            cls.logger.error("write upgrade log file failed, the log file:{}", cls.get_upgrade_log_path())
            return False

    @classmethod
    def close_log_writer(cls):
        try:
            if cls.upgrade_log_writer is not None:
                cls.upgrade_log_writer.close()
        except Exception as e:
            cls.logger.error("close upgrade log file failed, the log file:{}", cls.get_upgrade_log_path())
```

Note that I've made some assumptions about your environment and classes. You may need to adjust this code based on your specific requirements.
