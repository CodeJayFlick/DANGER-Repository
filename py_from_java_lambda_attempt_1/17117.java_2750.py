Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class StorageEngineException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message=None, cause=None, error_code=0):
        if cause:
            super().__init__(message, cause)
        elif message:
            super().__init__(message)
        else:
            super().__init__()
        self.error_code = error_code

def main():
    try:
        # some code that might raise an exception
        pass
    except StorageEngineException as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note:

- The equivalent of Java's `package` statement is not needed in Python, because it does not have a direct translation.
- In the constructor (`__init__`) method, we are using Python's built-in exception class (`Exception`). We can also define our own custom exceptions by subclassing from this base class.
