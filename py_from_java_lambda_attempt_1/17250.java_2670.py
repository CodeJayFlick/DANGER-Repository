Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class DeleteTimeSeriesOperator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.delete_path_list = None

    @property
    def delete_path_list(self):
        return self._delete_path_list

    @delete_path_list.setter
    def delete_path_list(self, value):
        self._delete_path_list = value

    def generate_physical_plan(self, generator):
        if not hasattr(generator, 'generate'):
            raise AttributeError("generator must have a method named 'generate'")

        return DeleteTimeSeriesPlan(self.delete_path_list)

class PartialPath:
    pass  # This is just an interface class in Java. In Python, we don't need to define it.

class Operator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.operator_type = None

    @property
    def operator_type(self):
        return self._operator_type

    @operator_type.setter
    def operator_type(self, value):
        self._operator_type = value


# Define a class for DeleteTimeSeriesPlan. This is similar to the Java code.
class DeleteTimeSeriesPlan:
    def __init__(self, delete_path_list):
        self.delete_path_list = delete_path_list

# You can use these classes like this:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    operator = DeleteTimeSeriesOperator()
    partial_paths = [PartialPath(), PartialPath()]
    operator.delete_path_list = partial_paths
    physical_plan = operator.generate_physical_plan(DeleteTimeSeriesPlan)
```

This Python code is equivalent to the given Java code. It defines classes for `DeleteTimeSeriesOperator`, `PartialPath`, and `DeleteTimeSeriesPlan`. The methods in these classes are similar to those in the original Java code, but they have been adapted to work with Python's syntax and semantics.
