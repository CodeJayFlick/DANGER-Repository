Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class ShowMergeStatusOperator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.operator_type = "SHOW_MERGE_STATUS"

    def generate_physical_plan(self) -> dict:
        return {"physical_plan": {}}
```

Note that this translation assumes a few things about the original Java code. 

1. The `tokenIntType` parameter in the constructor is not used, so it's omitted from the Python version.

2. In the `generatePhysicalPlan` method of the original Java code, an instance of `ShowMergeStatusPlan` was created and returned. This has been replaced with a dictionary representing a physical plan in the Python version.

3. The `OperatorType` enum is not present in the original Java code, so it's omitted from the Python version. Instead, we're using a string to represent the operator type.

4. Error handling (specifically throwing and catching exceptions) has been removed from this translation because error handling can be handled differently depending on the context of your application.
