Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class ShowMergeStatusPlan:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(ShowContentType.MERGE_STATUS)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass  # This is just an example, you can add your own code here
```
Note that I've removed the Java-specific comments and package declaration, as they are not necessary in Python. The `super()` function is used to call the parent class's constructor (`__init__` method), which is equivalent to calling the superclass's constructor in Java.
