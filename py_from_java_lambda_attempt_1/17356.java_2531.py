Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class ShowTriggersPlan:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(ShowContentType.TRIGGERS)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass
```
Note that I did not include any imports, as the code does not seem to rely on any specific Python modules or libraries.
