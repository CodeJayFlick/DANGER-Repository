Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
# Apache License header (just for reference)

import typing as t

class TsFileFilter(t.Protocol):
    def __call__(self, resource: 'TsFileResource') -> bool:
        ...

class TsFileResource:
    pass
```
Note that I've used type hints and the `t.Protocol` class from the `typing` module to define a protocol (i.e., an interface) in Python. This is equivalent to the Java interface definition.

The `__call__` method is defined as part of the protocol, which means it must be implemented by any class that conforms to this protocol. In other words, when you create an instance of a class that implements this protocol and call it like a function (e.g., `filter_instance(resource)`), Python will automatically invoke the `__call__` method.

The rest of the code is just placeholder classes for demonstration purposes; in a real-world implementation, you would define actual classes or functions to implement the `TsFileFilter` protocol.
