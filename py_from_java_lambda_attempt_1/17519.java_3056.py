Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import math

class UDTFCeil:
    def set_transformer(self):
        self.transformer = lambda x: math.ceil(x)
```
Note that in Python, we don't need to specify a package name or import specific classes like `Math`. We also use the built-in `math` module instead of importing it as a separate class. The rest of the code is straightforward translation from Java to Python.
