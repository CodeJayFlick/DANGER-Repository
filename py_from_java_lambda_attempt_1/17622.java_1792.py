Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python

    PERFORMANCE_STATISTIC_SERVICE = (
        "PERFORMANCE_STATISTIC_ SERVICE",

    )
    TVLIST_ALLOCATOR_SERVICE = ("TVList Allocator", "")
    UDF_CLASSLOADER_MANAGER_SERVICE = ("UDF Classloader Manager Service", "")
    UDF_REGISTRATION_SERVICE = ("UDF Registration Service", "")
    TEMPORARY_QUERY_DATA_FILE_SERVICE = (
        "Temporary Query Data File Service",
        ""
    )
    TRIGGER_REGISTRATION_SERVICE = ("Trigger Registration Service", "")
    CACHE_HIT_RATIO_DISPLAY_SERVICE = (
        "CACHE_ HIT_RATIO_ DISPLAY_ SERVICE",
        f"Cache Hit Ratio ({IoTDBConstant.IOTDB_PACKAGE}, 'Cache Hit Ratio'))"
    QUERY_TIME_MANAGER = ("Query time manager", "Query time")

    FLUSH_SERVICE = (
        "Flush ServerService",
        f"{generate_jmx_name('org.apache.iotdb.db.engine.pool', 'Flush Manager')}"
    )
    CLUSTER_MONITOR_SERVICE = ("Cluster Monitor ServerService", "Cluster Monitor")
    SYSTEMINFO_SERVICE = ("MemTable Monitor Service", "MemTable, Monitor")
    CONTINUOUS_QUERY_SERVICE = (

        "Continuous Query Service"
    )
    CLUSTER_INFO_SERVICE = (

        "Cluster Monitor-Thrift"
    )

    def __init__(self, name: str, jmx_name: str):
        self.name = name
        self.jmx_name = jmx_name

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return self._name

    @property
    def jmx_name(self) -> str:
        return self._jmx_name


def generate_jmx_name(package_name: str, jmx_name: str):
    return f"{package_name}:type={jmx_name}"
```

Please note that I have not included the `IoTDBConstant` class as it is not provided in your code. Also, Python does not support enum directly like Java or C++.
