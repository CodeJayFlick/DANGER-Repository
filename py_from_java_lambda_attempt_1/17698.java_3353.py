Here's how you can translate this Java annotation into a Python decorator:

```Python
def test_only(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Add any functionality here that should be executed before or after your function.
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return result
    return wrapper

# Usage:
@test_only
def my_function():
    pass
```

In this code:

- The `test_only` decorator is defined. It takes a function as an argument and returns another function (`wrapper`). This allows you to add any functionality before or after your original function.
- You can use the `@test_only` syntax above a Python function to mark it for testing only.

Please note that this code does not exactly replicate the Java annotation's behavior. The retention policy in Java is used to specify when an annotation should be retained (e.g., at runtime, or during compilation). In Python, decorators are more flexible and can provide similar functionality but with different syntax.
