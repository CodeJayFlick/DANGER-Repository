Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import pyodbc
from time import sleep

class IoTDBSensorUpdateIT:
    def setUp(self):
        pass  # No setup required in this case

    def tearDown(self):
        pass  # No teardown required in this case

    def test_merge(self):
        try:
            conn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};SERVER=127.0.0.1;PORT=6667;DATABASE=root;UID=root;PWD=root')
            cursor = conn.cursor()
            cursor.execute("set storage group to root.demo")
            cursor.execute("create timeseries root.demo.d1.s1 with datatype=INT64,encoding=RLE")
            cursor.execute("create timeseries root.demo.d1.s2 with datatype=INT64,encoding=RLE")
            cursor.execute("create timeseries root.demo.d1.s3 with datatype=INT64,encoding=RLE")
            cursor.execute("insert into root.demo.d1(time,s1) values(1,1)")
            conn.commit()
            cursor.execute("flush")
            cursor.execute("insert into root.demo.d1(time,s2) values(1,2)")
            conn.commit()
            cursor.execute("flush")
            cursor.execute("insert into root.demo.d1(time,s3) values(1,1)")
            conn.commit()
            cursor.execute("flush")

            result = cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM root.**").fetchall()
            cnt = 0
            for row in result:
                if "root.demo.d1.s3" in str(row):
                    cnt += 1
                    self.assertEqual(1, int(str(row).split(',')[4].strip('"')))

            cursor.execute("merge")
            sleep(1000)  # Wait for merge to complete

            result = cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM root.**").fetchall()
            cnt = 0
            for row in result:
                if "root.demo.d1.s3" in str(row):
                    cnt += 1
                    self.assertEqual(1, int(str(row).split(',')[4].strip('"')))

        except pyodbc.Error as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Please note that this code is not exactly equivalent to the original Java code. The main differences are:

- Python's `pyodbc` library does not support executing SQL commands with semicolons (`;`) at the end, so I removed them.
- In Python, you don't need to use a try-with-resources statement like in Java. Instead, you can simply call the close method on your cursor and connection objects when you're done using them.
- The `Thread.sleep(1000)` function is used instead of `java.lang.Thread.sleep(1000)`.
- In Python, you don't need to use a separate class for each test case like in Java. Instead, you can define all the tests as methods within one class.

Also note that this code assumes that you have an ODBC driver installed on your system and configured correctly.
