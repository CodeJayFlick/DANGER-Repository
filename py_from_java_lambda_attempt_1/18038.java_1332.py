Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class SynchronizedHandler:
    def __init__(self, client):
        self.client = client

    def invoke(self, proxy, method_name, args):
        try:
            with self.client as client:
                return getattr(client, method_name)(*args)
        except Exception as e:
            if isinstance(e, TException):
                raise e
            else:
                raise TException(f"Error in calling method {method_name}", e)

import thrift.TService

class TSIService(TService.Iface):
    pass

# Usage example:

client = TSIService()
handler = SynchronizedHandler(client)
```

Please note that this is a direct translation of the Java code to Python, and it might not be perfect. For instance, there's no equivalent for `InvocationTargetException` in Python. Also, I've assumed that you have the necessary thrift libraries installed and imported correctly.

Also, please keep in mind that Python does not support checked exceptions like Java, so we don't need to explicitly catch all types of exceptions as is done in the original code.
