Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```python
import io.BytesIO

class DoublePrecisionEncoderV2:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # equivalent to a no-op constructor in Java

    def encode(self, value: float, out: BytesIO) -> None:
        self.encode(Long.fromBits(Double.doubleToRawLongBits(value)).longValue(), out)

    def flush(self, out: BytesIO) -> None:
        self.encode(0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, out)  # equivalent to GORILLA_ENCODING_ENDING_DOUBLE
        bits_left = 0
        self.flip_byte(out)
        self.reset()

    def reset(self) -> None:
        pass  # equivalent to a no-op method in Java

    def flip_byte(self, out: BytesIO) -> None:
        pass  # equivalent to a no-op method in Java
```
Note that I've used the `BytesIO` class from the Python standard library for working with byte arrays. The rest of the code is straightforward translations of the original Java methods.

Also, please note that this translation assumes that you want to preserve the behavior and semantics of the original Java code as closely as possible. If there are any specific requirements or constraints that need to be taken into account during the translation process (e.g., compatibility with a particular Python version), please let me know!
