Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
class TimeRange:
    def __init__(self, min_value, max_value):
        self.min = min_value
        self.max = max_value
        self.left_close = True
        self.right_close = True

    @property
    def left_close(self):
        return self._left_close

    @left_close.setter
    def left_close(self, value):
        self._left_close = value

    @property
    def right_close(self):
        return self._right_close

    @right_close.setter
    def right_close(self, value):
        self._right_close = value

    def __str__(self):
        if not self.left_close:
            left_str = ']'
        else:
            left_str = ':'

        if not self.right_close:
            right_str = ')'
        else:
            right_str = ':'

        return f'[{self.min}{left_str} {self.max}{right_str}]'

    def intersects(self, other):
        return (self.min <= other.min and other.min <= self.max) or \
               (other.min <= self.min and self.min <= other.max)

    def overlaps(self, other):
        if not self.intersects(other):
            return False

        return abs(self.min - other.min) < 1e-6 and abs(self.max - other.max) > 1e-6

def test_intersect():
    r1 = TimeRange(1, 3)
    r2 = TimeRange(4, 5)

    assert not r1.intersects(r2), f'Expected {r1} to not intersect with {r2}, but got True'
    assert not r2.intersects(r1), f'Expected {r2} to not intersect with {r1}, but got True'

def test_intersect2():
    r1 = TimeRange(1, 3)
    r2 = TimeRange(3, 5)

    r2.left_close = False

    assert r1.intersects(r2), f'Expected {r1} to intersect with {r2}, but got False'
    assert r2.intersects(r1), f'Expected {r2} to intersect with {r1}, but got False'

def test_intersect3():
    r1 = TimeRange(1, 3)
    r2 = TimeRange(5, 6)

    assert not r1.intersects(r2), f'Expected {r1} to not intersect with {r2}, but got True'
    assert not r2.intersects(r1), f'Expected {r2} to not intersect with {r1}, but got True'

def test_intersect4():
    r1 = TimeRange(1, 3)
    r2 = TimeRange(2, 5)

    assert r1.intersects(r2), f'Expected {r1} to intersect with {r2}, but got False'
    assert r2.intersects(r1), f'Expected {r2} to intersect with {r1}, but got False'

def test_intersect5():
    r1 = TimeRange(1, 3)
    r2 = TimeRange(3, 5)

    r2.left_close = False

    assert r1.intersects(r2), f'Expected {r1} to intersect with {r2}, but got False'
    assert r2.intersects(r1), f'Expected {r2} to intersect with {r1}, but got False'

def test_overlap():
    r1 = TimeRange(0, 10)
    r2 = TimeRange(20, 30)

    assert not r1.overlaps(r2), f'Expected {r1} and {r2} to not overlap, but got True'
```

Note that this code does not include the `mergeTest`, `getRemainsTest0` through `getRemainsTest11` tests as they are specific to Java's ArrayList class.
