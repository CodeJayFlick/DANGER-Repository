Here is the translation of the Java interface `LogFormatter` to a Python class:

```python
class LogFormatter:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def format(self, req: dict, res: dict, ctx: dict) -> str:
        """
        Format method called by the container handler to produce the log line that should be written to the logs.

        Args:
            req (dict): The incoming request
            res (dict): The completed response
            ctx (dict): The security context produced based on the request

        Returns:
            str: The log line
        """
        # Implement your logging logic here. For example, you can use Python's built-in logging module.
        return f"Request: {req}, Response: {res}, Context: {ctx}"
```

Note that I've used type hints for the method parameters and return value to indicate their expected types. In Python, these are not enforced at runtime like they would be in Java with an interface definition.
