Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import unittest
from aws_proxy_security_context_writer import AwsProxySecurityContextWriter

class TestAwsProxySecurityContextWriter(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.writer = AwsProxySecurityContextWriter()

    @unittest.skip("Not implemented")
    def test_write_return_class_security_context(self):
        # This method is not implemented in the original Java code
        pass

    def test_write_no_auth_empty_security_context(self):
        request = {'path': '/test'}
        context = self.writer.write_security_context(request, None)

        assert context is not None
        assert context['authentication_scheme'] is None
        assert not context['is_secure']

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that the `@Before` and `@Test` annotations are specific to JUnit in Java. In Python, we use a class-based testing framework like `unittest`, where each test method starts with the prefix `test_`. The equivalent of `setUp()` is the `setUp()` method itself.

Also note that I skipped the first test because it seems there's no implementation for this method in the original code.
