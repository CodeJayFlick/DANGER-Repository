Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python code:

```Python
class DebuggerStackPlugin:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @property
    def provider(self):
        return self._provider

    @provider.setter
    def provider(self, value):
        self._provider = value

    def init(self):
        self.provider = DebuggerStackProvider(self)
        # super.init()  # This line is not needed in Python as it's a constructor call.

    def dispose(self):
        pass  # tool.removeComponentProvider(provider)  # In Java this would be done by the PluginTool, but here we just ignore it

    def process_event(self, event):
        if isinstance(event, TraceActivatedPluginEvent):
            ev = event
            self.provider.coordinates_activated(ev.get_active_coordinates())
        super.process_event(event)

class DebuggerStackProvider:
    def __init__(self, plugin):
        pass  # This class is not fully implemented in the given Java code.

    @property
    def coordinates(self):
        return None

    def coordinates_activated(self, active_coordinates):
        pass  # This method is not fully implemented in the given Java code.
```

Please note that this translation does not include all classes and methods from the original Java code. The `DebuggerStackProvider` class has been simplified to just have a property for its coordinates and an activation method which are both unimplemented.
