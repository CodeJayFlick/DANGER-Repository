Here is the equivalent Python code:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

hello_message = "Hello"

@app.route('/hello', methods=['GET'])
def hello():
    return jsonify({'message': hello_message})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Note that this is a Flask application in Python. The equivalent code for Django or other frameworks would be slightly different.

Here's what the translation involves:

* `@RestController` becomes nothing, as there isn't an exact equivalent in Python.
* `public static final String HELLO_MESSAGE = "Hello";` becomes a simple variable assignment.
* `@RequestMapping(path="/hello", method=RequestMethod.GET, produces={"text/plain"})` becomes a Flask route with the same path and HTTP method (`'GET'`). The `produces` part is not directly equivalent in Python, but you can achieve similar behavior using Flask's built-in support for JSON responses.
* `public Mono<String> hello() { return Mono.just(HELLO_MESSAGE); }` becomes a simple function that returns a JSON response with the desired message.
