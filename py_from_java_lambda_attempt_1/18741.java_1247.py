Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DeleteBranchBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def delete(self) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

# Define exceptions
class NessieConflictException(Exception):
    pass


class NessieNotFoundException(Exception):
    pass
```

Please note that the equivalent Python code does not exactly replicate the Java interface and classes. Instead, it provides a basic translation of the given Java code into Python syntax.
