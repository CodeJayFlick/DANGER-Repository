Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
import jsonpickle

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class EntriesResponse:
    entries: List['Entry'] = field(default_factory=list)

    @classmethod
    def builder(cls):
        return cls()

def get_entries(self) -> List['Entry']:
    return self.entries


@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Entry:
    type: 'Contents.Type' = None
    name: 'ContentsKey' = None

    @classmethod
    def builder(cls):
        return cls()


def get_type(self) -> 'Contents.Type':
    return self.type


def get_name(self) -> 'ContentsKey':
    return self.name


class Contents:
    class Type(str, Enum):
        pass  # Add your types here

    class Key(str, Enum):
        pass  # Add your keys here
```

Please note that this is a direct translation of the given Java code into Python. The equivalent Python classes and functions are used to mimic the behavior of their Java counterparts.

Here's what each part does:

- `EntriesResponse` and `Entry`: These are dataclasses, which in Python 3.7+ are a way to define simple immutable objects.
- `get_entries`, `get_type`, and `get_name`: These are methods that return the corresponding attributes of an instance of `EntriesResponse` or `Entry`.
- `builder` for both classes: This is a static method that returns a new builder object, which can be used to create instances of these classes.
- `Contents.Type` and `ContentsKey`: These are enums.
