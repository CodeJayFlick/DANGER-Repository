Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
# Copyright (C) 2020 Dremio

class QuarkusNativeProfileMongo:
    def get_config_profile(self):
        return "prod"
```
Note that I've removed all the boilerplate comments and license information, as they are not relevant to the translation itself. The resulting Python code is a simple class definition with a single method `get_config_profile` that returns the string `"prod"`.
