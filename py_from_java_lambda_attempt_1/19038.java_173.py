Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```python
import logging
from testcontainers import Container, GenericContainer
from awssdk.auth.credentials import AwsBasicCredentials
from awssdk.core.asyncio import create_default_session

class LocalDynamoTestConnectionProviderSource:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        self.container = None
        self.endpoint_uri = None

    def create_default_connection_provider_config(self):
        return {}

    def create_connection_provider(self):
        # Note: This is a placeholder, as the equivalent Java code creates an instance of DynamoDatabaseClient.
        pass  # Return something here?

    def start(self):
        if self.container:
            raise ValueError("Already started")

        version = os.environ.get('IT_NESSIE_CONTAINER_DYNALITE_TAG', 'latest')
        image_name = f"dimaqq/dynalite:{version}"

        container = GenericContainer(image_name)
        container.with_log_consumer(logging.StreamHandler(self.logger))
        container.with_exposed_port(8000)

        self.container = container
        self.container.start()

        port = self.container.get_first_mapped_port()
        self.endpoint_uri = f"http://localhost:{port}"

    def stop(self):
        try:
            super().stop()  # Note: This is a placeholder, as the equivalent Java code calls `super.stop()` on an unknown superclass.
        finally:
            if self.container:
                self.container.stop()
            self.container = None
```
Note that I've made some simplifications and assumptions in translating the code:

* The `DynamoClientConfig` class has been replaced with a simple dictionary (`{}`) for simplicity's sake. In Python, you might want to create an actual configuration object or use a library like `pydantic` to define a schema.
* The equivalent Java method `createConnectionProvider()` returns something (in this case, the placeholder `pass  # Return something here?`) but I couldn't determine what that should be in Python. You'll need to fill in the correct implementation for your use case.
* Similarly, the `start` and `stop` methods have been simplified or replaced with equivalent functionality using Python's built-in logging module.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
