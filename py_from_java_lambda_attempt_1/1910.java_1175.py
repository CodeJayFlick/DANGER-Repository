Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AbstractModelForLldbScenarioCloneExitTest:
    def get_specimen(self):
        return "MacOSSpecimen.CLONE_EXIT"

    def get_breakpoint_expression(self):
        return "work"
```

Note that this is a direct translation, and the resulting Python code may not be exactly equivalent to the original Java code. For example:

- In Java, `package agent.lldb.model;` declares a package for the class. This declaration does not have an exact counterpart in Python.
- The `extends AbstractDebuggerModelScenarioCloneExitTest` clause is used in Java to indicate inheritance from another class. There is no direct equivalent in Python (although you can use multiple inheritance).
- In Java, methods are declared with return types and parameter lists. In Python, these declarations are not necessary; the method's return value is determined by its last statement.
- The `@Override` annotation in Java indicates that a method overrides one from its superclass. This concept does not exist in Python (although you can use abstract classes to achieve similar behavior).
- In Java, strings are enclosed within double quotes (`"`) or single quotes (`'`). In Python, these enclosures are also used for strings.
- The `protected` access modifier is used in Java to restrict method accessibility. There is no direct equivalent in Python (although you can use private variables and methods with similar behavior).
