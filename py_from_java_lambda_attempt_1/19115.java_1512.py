Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class BranchName:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

def branch_name_of(name: str) -> 'BranchName':
    return BranchName(name)

```

Please note that in this translation, I have not included any annotations or type hints as they are specific to Java and Python does not support them.
