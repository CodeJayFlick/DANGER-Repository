Note that Python does not support Java-like annotations or package declarations out-of-the-box. The above code is just a direct translation of the given text into pure Python syntax.

Here's what I did:

1. Removed all Java-specific constructs (like `@NonNullByDefault`, `package`, etc.) as they are not supported in Python.
2. Kept only the copyright notice and license information, which can be useful to include in a Python file if you want to follow similar licensing practices.

If you need any specific functionality equivalent to those annotations or package declarations in Java, please let me know!
