Here's how you can translate this Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This is a comment in Python. It doesn't do anything.

class Cloner:
    """An interface for optionally cloning an object,
       should return the given object if no cloning is required.
    """

    def clone(self, t):
        # Here you would put your actual logic to handle the cloning of 't'
        pass
```

In this Python code:

- The `class Cloner:` line defines a new class called `Cloner`.
- The triple quotes (`"""`) are used for docstrings in Python. They provide documentation about what the class does.
- The `def clone(self, t):` method is similar to Java's interface methods. It takes two parameters: `self`, which refers to the instance of the class itself, and `t`.
- Inside this method, you would put your actual logic for cloning an object. In this case, I've left it blank (`pass`) because there isn't any specific implementation provided in the Java code.

This Python code doesn't exactly translate the given Java interface into a direct equivalent. Instead, it provides a class that can be used as a starting point to implement your own `Cloner` logic.
