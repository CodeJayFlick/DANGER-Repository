Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This file contains a simple interface definition for GadpClientTargetBreakpointLocation in Python.

class GadpClientTargetBreakpointLocation:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # Nothing to add, just like in Java.
```

Note that this is not exactly the same as the original code. In particular:

- The `package` statement at the top of the file does not have a direct equivalent in Python (Python's package system works differently).
- The `interface` keyword and its associated syntax do not exist in Python; instead, we define a class.
- There is no need for explicit type declarations or method signatures like there are in Java.
