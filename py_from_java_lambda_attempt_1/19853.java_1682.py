class Verbosity:
    LOW = 0
    NORMAL = 1
    HIGH = 2
    VERY_HIGH = 3
    DEBUG = 4

print(Verbosity.LOW)
```

Please note that Python does not have an exact equivalent to Java's enum. The above code uses a class with constant variables instead, which serves the same purpose as an enum in Java.
