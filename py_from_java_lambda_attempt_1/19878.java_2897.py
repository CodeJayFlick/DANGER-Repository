Note that Python does not support Java-like constructs such as packages, annotations (like `@NonNullByDefault`), or imports from specific libraries. The above code is simply a comment block with the same text as in the original Java file.

If you're looking to create equivalent functionality in Python, it would depend on what exactly you want to achieve. For example, if you want to add type hints for non-null values, you could use Python's built-in `Optional` and `Union` types from the typing module:

```
from typing import Optional, Union

def my_function(x: Optional[int] = None) -> int:
    # function implementation
```
