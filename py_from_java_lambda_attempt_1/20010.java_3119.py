class Setter:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def set(self, t: 'T') -> None:
        ...
```

Please note that Python does not support interfaces like Java's interface keyword. Instead, we can use abstract classes or protocols (in the context of type hints) to achieve similar functionality.

In this translation, I have used an abstract class `Setter` with a method `set`. The `...` in the implementation is just a placeholder and should be replaced according to your actual needs.
