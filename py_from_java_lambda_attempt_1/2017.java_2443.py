Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
class JdiThreadInfo:
    @staticmethod
    def add_thread(thread):
        # TODO Auto-generated method stub

    @staticmethod
    def remove_thread(thread):
        # TODO Auto-Generated method stub

    @staticmethod
    def invalidate_all():
        # TODO Auto-generated method stub

    @staticmethod
    def set_current_thread(thread):
        # TODO Auto-Generated method stub
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `public` and `static` keywords. In Python, the concept of public and private is handled through naming conventions (e.g., single leading underscore for "private" variables). The `@staticmethod` decorator in this code serves as an indication that these methods are intended to be static methods, but it does not have any direct effect on their behavior or accessibility.
