Here's the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class JdiModelTargetAccessConditioned:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def is_accessible(self) -> bool:
        return True  # This method should be implemented based on actual requirements.
```

Please note that this code does not exactly translate the given Java interface. Python and Java are different languages with their own syntax, so some parts of the translation may need to be adjusted or rethought for a more natural fit in Python.

In particular:

- The `@Override` annotation is used in Java to indicate that a method overrides one from its superclass. In Python, this concept does not exist; instead, you would define your own methods.
- The `<T>` type parameter declaration is specific to Java's generics system and has no direct equivalent in Python.

The given code seems to be part of the Ghidra software framework for reverse engineering binary files.
