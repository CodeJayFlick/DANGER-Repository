Here is a translation of the Java interface into equivalent Python code:

```Python
import asyncio

class JdiModelTargetAttacher:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    async def attach(self, attachable: 'TargetAttachable') -> asyncio.Future:
        # implement your logic here
        return await asyncio.create_future()

    async def attach(self, pid: int) -> asyncio.Future:
        # implement your logic here
        return await asyncio.create_future()
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's CompletableFuture. The closest thing is the `asyncio` library which provides support for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, including support for asynchronous I/O and parallelism.

Also, in Python, we don't need to specify types like `<T>` or use explicit type declarations as it does not have a statically typed nature.
