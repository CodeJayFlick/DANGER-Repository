Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
from typing import Any

class JdiModelTargetSteppable:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def step(self, kind: str) -> Any:
        # This method should return something that can be awaited.
        # For example, you could use asyncio.create_task() to create a task
        # and then await it. Here's an example of how you might do this:

        import asyncio

        async def target_step():
            pass  # Replace with your actual step logic.

        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        task = loop.create_task(target_step())
        return task
```

Note that the `step` method in Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's CompletableFuture. Instead, you would typically use the built-in support for asynchronous I/O provided by the asyncio library or another third-party library like trio.

Also note that this translation is just one possible way of translating the given interface into a Python class. The actual implementation will depend on your specific needs and requirements.
