Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

class AsyncSequenceActionRuns(Generic[R]):
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # Nothing in this class for now

# Note: The following types are not available in standard Python libraries.
# They might be implemented as custom classes or interfaces if needed.

TypeSpec = object
AsyncUtils = None
```

Here's a brief explanation of the translation:

- In Java, `package` is used to declare the package name. This concept doesn't exist directly in Python (it uses modules instead). So we won't include it here.
- The import statements are translated into equivalent imports or declarations as needed. For example, `import java.util.function.Consumer;` would be replaced with a declaration of a custom class if you need to use similar functionality in your code.
- Java interfaces are represented by Python classes that inherit from the built-in `object`. This is because Python doesn't have direct support for interfaces like Java does.

Please note that this translation assumes that equivalent types and utilities exist or can be implemented as needed.
