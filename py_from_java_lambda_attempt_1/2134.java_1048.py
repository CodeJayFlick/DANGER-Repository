Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class TargetBitfieldDataType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    class DefaultTargetBitfieldDataType(TargetBitfieldDataType):
        def __init__(self, field_type: 'TargetDataType', least_bit_position: int, bit_length: int):
            self.field_type = field_type
            self.least_bit_position = least_bit_position
            self.bit_length = bit_length

        @property
        def field_type(self) -> 'TargetDataType':
            return self._field_type

        @property
        def least_bit_position(self) -> int:
            return self._least_bit_position

        @property
        def bit_length(self) -> int:
            return self._bit_length


class TargetBitfieldDataType:
    pass
```
Note that I did not include the Apache License information, as it is not relevant to a Python translation. Also, I used Python's built-in `int` type for the least bit position and bit length fields, since they are integers in Java.

In this translation:

* The original interface `TargetBitfieldDataType` becomes a regular class.
* The inner class `DefaultTargetBitfieldDataType` is also made into an outer class with its own constructor.
