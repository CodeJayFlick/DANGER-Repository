Here is the translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DebuggerRegisterAccessException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message, cause=None):
        super().__init__(message)
        self.cause = cause


def main():
    try:
        # Your code here that might raise this exception
        pass
    except DebuggerRegisterAccessException as e:
        print(f"Debugger Register Access Exception: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note:

- The Java package declaration is not directly translatable to Python. Instead, we define a class `DebuggerRegisterAccessException` that inherits from the built-in `Exception`.
- In Python, exceptions are raised using the `raise` statement or by passing an exception instance as an argument.
- We've kept the same method names and signatures for consistency with Java.
