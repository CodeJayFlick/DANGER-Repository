Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import asyncio

class MemoryReader:
    async def read_memory(self, address: int, length: int) -> bytes:
        # TODO: Use bytearray instead?
        return await self._wrapped_read(address, length)

    async def _wrapped_read(self, address: int, length: int) -> bytes:
        pass  # Implement the wrapped read method
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `CompletableFuture` and `ByteBuffer`. The equivalent in Python would be using coroutines (with `async/await`) or callbacks to handle asynchronous operations.
