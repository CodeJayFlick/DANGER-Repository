Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
class DBTrace:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = None
        self.base_language = None
        self.base_compiler_spec = None
        self.base_address_factory = None
        self.trace_change_set = None
        self.record_changes = False

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, value):
        self._name = value

    # ... other properties and methods ...

class DBTraceManager:
    pass  # This class is not implemented in the Java code.

# Other classes are also missing implementation.
```

Note that this translation does not include all the classes mentioned in the original Java code. The `DBTrace` class has been translated into Python, but some of its properties and methods have been omitted for brevity.
