Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class EnableBreakpointActionItem:
    def __init__(self, togglable):
        self.togglable = togglable

    def equals(self, obj):
        if not isinstance(obj, EnableBreakpointActionItem):
            return False
        that = obj
        if self.togglable != that.togglable:
            return False
        return True

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((type(self), self.togglable))

    async def execute(self):
        await self.togglable.enable()
```
Note:

* In Python, we don't need to specify the `public` access modifier as it's implicit.
* The `@Override` annotation is not needed in Python since method overriding works differently than Java.
* We use the built-in `hash()` function to calculate the hash code of the object. Since we're using a tuple `(type(self), self.togglable)` as the basis for the hash, this ensures that two instances with the same `togglable` attribute will have the same hash value.
* The `CompletableFuture< Void >` type is not directly translatable to Python since it's a Java-specific concept. Instead, we use the built-in `async/await` syntax to create an asynchronous function that returns a coroutine object.

This code should be equivalent in functionality to the original Java code.
