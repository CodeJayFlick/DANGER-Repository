Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class TraceRegisterContextRegisterSpace(TraceRegisterContextSpace):
    def get_thread(self) -> 'TraceThread':
        pass  # implement this method
```
Note that I've kept the `get_thread` method as a placeholder, since it's not possible to translate the entire `ghidra.trace.model.thread.TraceThread` class from Java to Python without knowing more about its implementation and dependencies.

In general, when translating Java code to Python, you'll need to replace:

* `public interface` with `class`
* `extends` with inheritance (e.g., `(TraceRegisterContextSpace)`)
* Method signatures (`return type method_name(parameters)` -> `def method_name(self, parameters): return_type`)
