Here's the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
from typing import TypeVar

class TraceBaseDefinedUnitsView:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def clear(self, span: range, address_range: tuple, clear_context: bool = False) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError("This method is not implemented")

T = TypeVar('T', bound='TraceCodeUnit')

class TraceCodeUnit:
    pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents of Java interfaces or generics. The above code uses a class and type hints to achieve similar functionality.

The `clear` method in the original interface has been translated into a regular function, as there is no equivalent concept like abstract methods in Python.
