Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class TraceAddressSnapRangePropertyMapSpace:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def get_address_space(self) -> 'AddressSpace':
        return None  # Replace with actual implementation


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AddressSpace(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def __str__(self):
        pass
```

Please note that Python does not support generic types like Java. The `T` in the original code is equivalent to a type parameter in Python which can be replaced with any data type as needed.

Also, Python's abstract classes are implemented using ABC (Abstract Base Classes) module and the `@abstractmethod` decorator.
