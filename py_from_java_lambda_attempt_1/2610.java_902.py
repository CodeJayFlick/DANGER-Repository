Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class TraceVariableSymbol:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def get_function(self) -> 'TraceFunctionSymbol':
        return None  # or any other default value you want to return
```

Note that in this translation, I have not included the `import` statement as Python does not require explicit imports for classes defined within a file. Also, since there is no equivalent of Java's interface concept in Python (Python uses abstract base classes), we are using a regular class here with all methods being instance methods by default.
