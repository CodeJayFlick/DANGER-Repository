Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DependentServiceConstructor:
    def __init__(self, cls: type, method):
        if not isinstance(cls, type) or not callable(method):
            raise ValueError("cls must be a class and method must be a function")
        self.cls = cls
        self.method = method

    @staticmethod
    def construct(obj, dependencies):
        try:
            return self.method.__get__(obj)(*[dependencies.get(param_type) for param_type in self.method.__code__.co_varnames[1:]])
        except Exception as e:
            raise ServiceConstructionException(f"Error constructing dependent service via {self.method}", e)

class ServiceConstructionException(Exception):
    pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java's generics, reflection, or exception types. This translation focuses on the core logic of the code and uses equivalent constructs in Python.

Here are some key differences:

- The `DependentServiceConstructor` class is defined without type parameters (equivalent to Java's generic classes).
- The constructor (`__init__`) method takes two arguments: a class object (`cls`) and a function (`method`). It checks if these inputs meet certain conditions.
- The `construct` method creates an instance of the dependent service by calling the provided method with the given dependencies. This is equivalent to Java's reflection-based invocation of methods.

The code also includes a custom exception type, `ServiceConstructionException`, which inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`.
