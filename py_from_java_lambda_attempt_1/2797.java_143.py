Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DBAnnotatedObjectFactory:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def create(self, store: 'DBCachedObjectStore', record: 'DBRecord') -> 'T':
        # Your implementation here to create an object based on the input parameters.
        pass

# Assuming T is a generic type that extends DBAnnotatedObject
class DBCachedObjectStore:
    pass

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DBAnnotatedObject(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

Please note that Python does not support generics like Java. The `T` in the original code is a generic type parameter and we have replaced it with an object of unknown type (`'T'`) for demonstration purposes only.
