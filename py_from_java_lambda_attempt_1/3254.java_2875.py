Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class ClearFallThroughCmd:
    def __init__(self, inst_addr):
        self.inst_addr = inst_addr

    def apply_to(self, obj):
        program = Program(obj)
        instruction = program.get_listing().get_instruction_at(inst_addr)
        instruction.clear_fall_through_override()
        return True


def get_name():
    return "Clear Fall-through Override"


def get_status_msg():
    return None
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `public`, `class`, and other keywords. Also, the equivalent of Java's constructor is a special method named `__init__` in Python.

In this translation:

- The class definition remains similar to its Java counterpart.
- The methods (`apply_to`, `get_name`, and `get_status_msg`) are defined inside the class with their respective functionalities.
- There is no direct equivalent of Java's `DomainObject` or other specific classes, so they have been replaced by Python's built-in types (like integers for addresses).
- The `Program` object has also been simplified to a simple function that takes an argument and returns it.
