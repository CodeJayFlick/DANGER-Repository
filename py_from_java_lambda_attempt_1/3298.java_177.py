Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class GhidraToolStateFactory:
    def create_tool_state(self, tool: 'PluginTool', domain_object: 'DomainObject') -> 'GhidraToolState':
        return GhidraToolState(tool, domain_object)

# Note: In Python, we don't need an explicit `@Override` annotation
```
Here's a brief explanation of the translation:

* The Java class is translated to a Python class with the same name.
* The constructor (`public class`) becomes a simple definition (`class`).
* The `package` declaration and licensing information are not needed in Python, as they are specific to Java.
* The imports are removed, as Python has its own way of handling dependencies (e.g., importing modules or classes using the `import` statement).
* The method signature is translated from Java's `public class GhidraToolStateFactory extends ToolStateFactory { ... }` to a simple Python function definition (`def create_tool_state(self, tool: 'PluginTool', domain_object: 'DomainObject') -> 'GhidraToolState':`). Note that the type hints are used in Python 3.5 and later.
* The `@Override` annotation is not needed in Python, as it's a Java-specific feature.

Keep in mind that this translation assumes you have already defined the classes `PluginTool`, `DomainObject`, and `GhidraToolState` elsewhere in your code or imported them from other modules.
