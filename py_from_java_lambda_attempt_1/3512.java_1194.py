Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This plugin shows tooltip text for hovering over data types in the listing.
class DataTypeListingHoverPlugin:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hover_service = None

    # Initialize the plugin with the given tool and register services provided by this plugin.
    def initialize(self, tool):
        super().__init__()
        self.hover_service = DataTypeListingHover(tool)
        ListingHoverService.register(self.hover_service)

    # Dispose of any resources held by this plugin when it is no longer needed.
    def dispose(self):
        if self.hover_service:
            self.hover_service.dispose()
            self.hover_service = None

class DataTypeListingHover:
    def __init__(self, tool):
        pass  # Implement the logic for hovering over data types in the listing.

    def dispose(self):
        pass  # Dispose of any resources held by this plugin when it is no longer needed.
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent to Java's annotations and plugins. The above code is a translation of your provided Java code into Python, but you may need to implement the logic for hovering over data types in the listing as well as registering services provided by this plugin differently than how it was done in Java.

Also, note that `ListingHoverService` class does not exist in Python and its usage might be different.
