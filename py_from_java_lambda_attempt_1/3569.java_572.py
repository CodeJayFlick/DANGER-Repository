Here's the translation of the given Java interface into a Python equivalent:

```Python
class CompositeModelDataListener:
    def component_data_changed(self):
        pass
    
    def composite_info_changed(self):
        pass
```

In this Python version, we define a class `CompositeModelDataListener` that has two methods: `component_data_changed()` and `composite_info_changed()`. These methods are equivalent to the Java interface's method signatures. The actual implementation of these methods is left blank (`pass`) as per your request.
