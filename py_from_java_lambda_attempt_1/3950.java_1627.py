Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python code:

```Python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox
from typing import Set, List

class ProcessorListPlugin:
    def __init__(self):
        self.processor_list_action = None
        self.dialog_provider = None

    def setup_actions(self):
        if not hasattr(self, 'processor_list_action'):
            self.processor_list_action = tk.Button(text="Installed Processors", command=self.show_processor_list)
            self.processor_list_action.pack()

    def dispose(self):
        pass  # No equivalent in Python for disposing of actions

    def show_processor_list(self):
        if self.dialog_provider is None:
            self.dialog_provider = ProcessorListDialogProvider()
        self.dialog_provider.display()

class ProcessorListDialogProvider:
    def __init__(self, owner=None):
        super().__init__()
        self.owner = owner
        self.build_table()

    def build_table(self):
        processors: Set[Processor] = set()  # No equivalent in Python for TreeSet
        language_service = DefaultLanguageService()
        for lang_description in language_service.get_language_descriptions():
            processors.add(lang_description.processor)

class ProcessorListTableModel:
    PROCESSOR_COL = 0

    def __init__(self, processors: List[Processor]):
        self.processors = processors

    def get_column_value_for_row(self, p: Processor, column_index: int):
        if column_index == self.PROCESSOR_COL:
            return str(p)
        else:
            return None
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `TreeSet`, `Transferable`, or some other classes. Also, the code is simplified and may require additional modifications to work correctly in a Python environment.

Here are some key differences between the original Java code and this translation:

1. The `@PluginInfo` annotation has no equivalent in Python.
2. In Python, you don't need to explicitly define getter and setter methods for class attributes like you do in Java.
3. There is no direct equivalent of Java's `TreeSet` or other specialized data structures in Python; instead, you can use built-in types like lists or dictionaries.
4. The code does not include the implementation details of some classes (like `ProcessorListTableProvider`, `GTable`, and others) as they are not relevant to this translation.

To make this code work correctly, you would need to implement these missing pieces in Python using standard libraries and data structures.
