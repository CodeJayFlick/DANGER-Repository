Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class DebugClientReentrant:
    def create_client(self):
        # Implement this method as per your requirement.
        pass

    def get_control(self):
        # Implement this method as per your requirement.
        pass

    def end_session_reentrant(self):
        # Implement this method as per your requirement.
        pass
```

Please note that the above Python class is just a translation of the given Java interface and does not contain any actual implementation. The `create_client`, `get_control` and `end_session_reentrant` methods are placeholders for actual code, which you would need to implement based on your specific requirements.
