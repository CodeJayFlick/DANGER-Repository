Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
class PreviewTable:
    def __init__(self, num_columns, plugin, dialog):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_columns = num_columns
        self.plugin = plugin
        self.dialog = dialog
        # ... other initialization ...

    def get_scrollable_tracks_viewport_width(self) -> bool:
        width = 0
        for row in range(get_row_count()):
            rendererr = get_cell_renderer(row, 0)
            comp = prepare_renderer(rendererr, row, 0)
            width = max(comp.get_preferred_width(), width)

        self.set_preferred_size((width, get_preferred_height()))

        return get_preferred_width() < parent().get_width()

    def add_preview_string(self, preview_text: str, index: int) -> None:
        self.preview_string_map[index] = preview_text
        refresh_view()

    # ... other methods ...

class InstructionSearchPlugin:
    pass

class PluginTool:
    pass

class ResourceManager:
    @staticmethod
    def load_image(image_name):
        return image_name  # Assuming the image is stored in a dictionary or something similar.

# Other classes and functions are not translated as they were not provided.
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's Swing, AWT, and other libraries. The translation above focuses on translating the logic of the code into equivalent Python constructs.
