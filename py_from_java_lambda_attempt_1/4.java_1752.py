Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import asyncio

class AsyncPlayerSendSuggestionsEvent:
    def __init__(self, player, suggestions, buffer):
        self.player = player
        self.suggestions = suggestions
        self.buffer = buffer

    @property
    def get_buffer(self):
        return self.buffer

    @property
    def get_suggestions(self):
        return self.suggestions

    def set_suggestions(self, suggestions):
        self.suggestions = suggestions

    async def is_cancelled(self):
        return self.cancelled

    async def set_cancelled(self, cancel):
        self.cancelled = cancel

    @property
    def handlers(self):
        return HandlerList()

class HandlerList:
    pass
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the Python equivalent of Java concepts like `HandlerList` and `Cancellable`. In particular:

* The `HandlerList` class is simply a placeholder, as there doesn't seem to be an exact equivalent in Python.
* The `is_cancelled()` and `set_cancelled()` methods are marked as `async`, since they appear to be related to asynchronous event handling. However, this may not be the correct interpretation of these methods.

Also note that I did not translate the Java docstrings or annotations (like `@NotNull`) into Python equivalents, as these are typically used for documentation and code readability purposes rather than affecting the actual behavior of the code.
