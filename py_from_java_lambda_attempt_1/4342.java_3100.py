Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class StringDataInstanceColumnTypeMapper:
    def convert(self, value):
        return str(value)
```

Note that in this translation, I have removed the `extends` keyword as it does not exist in Python and replaced the `@Override` decorator with nothing because Python does not support method overriding.
