Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class LongRenderer:
    def get_table_cell_renderer_component(self, data):
        renderer = super().get_table_cell_renderer_component(data)
        if isinstance(renderer, JLabel):
            renderer.setHorizontalAlignment("LEADING")
        return renderer

    def get_text(self, value):
        if value is None:
            return ""
        else:
            return "0x" + hex(value)[2:]

# You can use this class as follows
long_renderer = LongRenderer()
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's Swing and AWT. The above code uses built-in Python features to achieve the same functionality.

- `getTableCellRendererComponent` is replaced with a method named `get_table_cell_renderer_component`.
- `JLabel` is replaced with no specific class as there isn't an exact equivalent in Python.
- `SwingConstants.LEADING` is replaced with string "LEADING".
- `Long.toHexString(value)` and `java.lang.Long.toHexString(value)` are both replaced with the built-in Python function `hex()`.
