Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class DebugClientImpl7(DebugClientImpl6):
    def __init__(self, jna_client: IDebugClient7):
        super().__init__(jna_client)
        self.jna_client = jna_client
```
Note that:

* In Python, we don't need a `package` declaration or an `import` statement for the Java equivalent of `IDebugClient7`, since it's not a built-in type.
* The `@SuppressWarnings("unused")` annotation is not necessary in Python, as unused variables are simply ignored by default.
* The constructor (`__init__`) takes a single argument `jna_client` which is assigned to the instance variable `self.jna_client`.
* We use the `super()` function to call the parent class's constructor (in this case, `DebugClientImpl6`).
