Here is the translation of the Java interface `DataTypeReferenceFinder` into a Python class:

```Python
class DataTypeReferenceFinder:
    def find_references(self, program: 'Program', data_type: 'DataType',
                        callback: callable, monitor: object) -> None:
        # Your implementation here. This method should be implemented in subclasses.
        pass

    def find_references_for_field(self, program: 'Program', composite: 'Composite',
                                   field_name: str, callback: callable,
                                   monitor: object) -> None:
        # Your implementation here. This method should be implemented in subclasses.
        pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java interfaces and extension points. The above code is a translation of the interface into a class with abstract methods.

Here's how you can use this class:

```Python
class MyDataTypeReferenceFinder(DataTypeReferenceFinder):
    def find_references(self, program: 'Program', data_type: 'DataType',
                        callback: callable, monitor: object) -> None:
        # Your implementation here.
        pass

    def find_references_for_field(self, program: 'Program', composite: 'Composite',
                                   field_name: str, callback: callable,
                                   monitor: object) -> None:
        # Your implementation here.
        pass
```

In this example `MyDataTypeReferenceFinder` is a subclass of `DataTypeReferenceFinder`.
