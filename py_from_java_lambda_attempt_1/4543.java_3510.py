Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This line is a comment in Python
class FileSystemBrowserService:
    """A service to interact with file systems."""

    def open_file_system(self, fsrl):
        """
        Opens the given FSRL in a file system browser.

        :param fsrl: The thing to open in a file system browser.
        """
        pass  # This is just an example implementation. You would need to implement this method based on your requirements.
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface concept, but we can achieve similar functionality using abstract classes or base classes with pure virtual methods (methods without implementations). In the above code, I used a class as it seems like you want to encapsulate some behavior related to file system browsing.
