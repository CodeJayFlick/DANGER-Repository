Here is the translation of the Java interface `TableChooserExecutor` into a Python class:

```python
class TableChooserExecutor:
    def get_button_name(self):
        """A short name suitable for display in the "apply" button that indicates what the "apply" action does."""
        pass  # implement this method

    def execute(self, row_object: 'AddressableRowObject') -> bool:
        """
        Applies this executor's action to the given row object. Return True if the given object should be removed from the table.
        
        :param row_object: The AddressableRowObject to be executed upon
        :return: True if the rowObject should be removed from the table, False otherwise
        """
        pass  # implement this method


class AddressableRowObject:
    """An abstract class representing a row object that can be addressed."""
    pass
```

Note that I've kept the `AddressableRowObject` as an abstract class in Python, equivalent to the Java interface. In Python, you would typically define concrete classes or instances of this abstract class instead of implementing it like you would with an interface in Java.

Also note that I haven't implemented any actual logic for these methods yet; they are just placeholders until you decide how you want them to behave.
