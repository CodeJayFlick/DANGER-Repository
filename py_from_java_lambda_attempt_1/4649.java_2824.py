class DWARFAttributeValue:
    """Base interface for all DWARF attribute value implementations.  Not much here."""

Please note that Python does not have direct support for interfaces like Java. Instead, we can use abstract classes or protocols to achieve similar functionality. In this case, I've used a simple class definition as the equivalent of an interface in Java.
