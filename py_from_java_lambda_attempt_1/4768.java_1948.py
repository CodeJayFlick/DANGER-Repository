Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Define a class with constants
class DynamicSymbolTableConstants:
    INDIRECT_SYMBOL_LOCAL = 0x80000000
    INDIRECT_SYMBOL_ABS = 0x40000000
```

This Python code defines a class `DynamicSymbolTableConstants` and assigns the same values to two constants as in the Java code.
