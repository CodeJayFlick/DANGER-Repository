class DebugSymbolsImpl5:
    def __init__(self, jna_symbols):
        super().__init__(jna_symbols)
        self.jna_symbols = jna_symbols
```
Note that I removed all the Java-specific comments and license information, as they are not relevant to Python. The code itself is simply a class definition with an `__init__` method, which initializes the object's attributes using the provided `jna_symbols` argument.
