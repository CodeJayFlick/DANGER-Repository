Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class ThreadState:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_instruction_pointer(self) -> int:
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")
```

Note that in this translation, I have used a similar class structure to the original Java code. The `get_instruction_pointer` method is declared as abstract in the Java version and has been translated into Python by raising an exception (`NotImplementedError`) when called.
