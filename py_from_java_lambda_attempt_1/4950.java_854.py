Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class OmfException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message):
        super().__init__(message)
```

Note that in Python, we don't need a `public` keyword to define classes or methods. Also, exception handling works similarly to Java's try-except blocks, but the syntax is slightly different.
