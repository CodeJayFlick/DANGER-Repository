Here is a translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class WrapIDebugBreakpoint2:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __init__(self, pv_instance):
        super().__init__()

    def get_command_wide(self, buffer, buffer_size, command_size):
        # This method is not implemented in the given Java code.
        return None  # Return a default value or raise an exception.

    def set_comamnd_wide(self, command):
        # This method is not implemented in the given Java code.
        pass

    def get_offset_expression_wide(self, buffer, buffer_size, expression_size):
        # This method is not implemented in the given Java code.
        return None  # Return a default value or raise an exception.

    def set_offset_expression_wide(self, expression):
        # This method is not implemented in the given Java code.
        pass
```

Please note that this translation does not include any JNA (Java Native Access) functionality. Python has its own way of interacting with native libraries and operating system resources through modules like `ctypes` or `subprocess`.
