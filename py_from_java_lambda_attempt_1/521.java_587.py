Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class WrapIDebugControl2:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __init__(self, pv_instance):
        super().__init__(pv_instance)

# Define a nested class ByReference that inherits from Structure.ByReference
class ByReference(Structure.ByReference):
    _fields_ = []
```

Note: The equivalent Python code does not include the Java-specific imports and licenses as they are not applicable in Python.
