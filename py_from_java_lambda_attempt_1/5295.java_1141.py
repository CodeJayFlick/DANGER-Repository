Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class Demangler:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def can_demangle(self, program: 'Program') -> bool:
        return True  # Replace this with your actual implementation.

    @property
    def demangled_exception(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("DemangledException not implemented")

    def demangle(self, mangled: str) -> object:
        try:
            if self.can_demangle(mangled):  # Check the program before demangling.
                return DemangledObject()  # Replace this with your actual implementation.
            else:
                raise self.demangled_exception
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error while demangling: {e}")

    def create_default_options(self) -> object:
        from . import DemanglerOptions
        return DemanglerOptions()
```

Note that Python does not have direct support for interfaces like Java. Instead, we use abstract base classes (ABCs). The `DemangledObject` and `Program` are also placeholders as they were not provided in the original code.

The above translation is based on my understanding of your requirements. Please let me know if you need any further modifications or clarifications.
