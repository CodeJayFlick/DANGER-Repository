Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from typing import List

class DataTypeDiffInput:
    def get_lines(self) -> List[ValidatableLine]:
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass.

    def create_place_holder(self, opposite_line: ValidatableLine) -> PlaceHolderLine:
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass.
```

In the above Python code:

- We have a class `DataTypeDiffInput` which is equivalent to an interface in Java. It has two methods `get_lines()` and `create_place_holder()`. These are abstract methods, meaning they should be implemented by any class that inherits from `DataTypeDiffInput`.

Note: The classes `ValidatableLine`, `PlaceHolderLine` have not been defined here as their definitions were missing in the given Java code. You would need to define these classes or use existing ones depending on your requirements.

Also note, Python does not support interfaces like Java but it supports abstract base classes (ABCs) which can be used for similar purposes.
