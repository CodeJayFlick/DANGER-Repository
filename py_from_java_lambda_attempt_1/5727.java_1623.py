Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class CallGraphType:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Call Graph", "Shows relationships between functions")
```
Note that I've kept the same class name and method names as in the original Java code, but with the obvious changes to conform to Python's syntax.
