Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
import uuid

class IDebugSymbolGroup2:
    IID_IDEBUG_SYMBOL_GROUP2 = uuid.UUID("6a7ccc5f-fb5e-4dcc-b41c-6c20307bccc7")
```

Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we use the term "class" to define an abstract class or interface. The `uuid` module is used to create a UUID object from the given string representation.
