Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class TestLogger:
    def log_state(self, emulator_test_runner):
        pass  # implement this method in your subclass

    def log_state(self, emulator_test_runner: 'EmulatorTestRunner', dump_addr: int, 
                   dump_size: int, element_size: int, element_format: str, comment: str) -> None:
        pass  # implement this method in your subclass

    def log(self, test_group: object, msg: str):
        pass  # implement this method in your subclass

    def log(self, test_group: object, msg: str, t: Exception):
        pass  # implement this method in your subclass
```

Note that the `log_state` and other methods are currently just placeholders (`pass`) because they don't have a direct equivalent in Python. You would need to define these methods based on how you want them to behave.

Also note that I used type hints for clarity, but these will not be enforced by Python unless you're using a static analysis tool or running your code through an interpreter like PyCharm's built-in one.
