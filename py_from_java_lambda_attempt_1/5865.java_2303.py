Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class InstructionSkipper:
    def get_applicable_processor(self):
        # TO DO: implement this method in Python equivalent
        pass

    def should_skip(self, buffer: bytes, size: int) -> bool:
        return False  # default implementation, override as needed
```
Note that I've kept the `get_applicable_processor` method abstract for now, since it's not clear how to translate this method directly from Java. You may need to implement a Python equivalent using a different approach.

The `should_skip` method is translated straightforwardly, with some minor adjustments to accommodate Python's syntax and type system.
