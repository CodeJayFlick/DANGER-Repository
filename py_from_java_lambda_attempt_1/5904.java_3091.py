Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class CustomLoadingAddressTableModel:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str, service_provider, program, loader, monitor):
        self.loader = loader
        super().__init__(model_name, service_provider, program, monitor)

    def __init__(self, model_name: str, service_provider, program, loader, monitor, load_incrementally=False):
        self.loader = loader
        super().__init__(model_name, service_provider, program, monitor, load_incrementally)

    def do_load(self, accumulator, monitor) -> None:
        try:
            self.loader.load(accumulator, monitor)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `package`, `import` statements or the concept of a class extending another. The equivalent in Python is to define classes and functions directly without any additional declarations.

Also, note that Python does not support generics like Java does with its `<Address>` syntax. In this translation, I've simply removed these parts as they are not necessary for Python code.
