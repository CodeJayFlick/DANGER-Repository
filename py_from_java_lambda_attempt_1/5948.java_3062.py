Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod

class ProgramLocationTableColumnExtensionPoint(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """
    A convenience class that allows subclasses to signal that they implement 
    `ProgramLocationTableColumn` and that they are extension points.
    
    If you do not wish to be an extension point, but do wish to provide ProgramLocation objects,
    then you can just implement `ProgramLocationTableColumn` or extend 
    `AbstractProgramLocationTableColumn`.
    
    :param ROW_TYPE: The row object class supported by this column
    :param COLUMN_TYPE: The column object class supported by this column
    """
    @abstractmethod
    def __init__(self, row_type, column_type):
        self.row_type = row_type
        self.column_type = column_type

# Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface or abstract classes.
# Instead we use Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) to define the structure and behavior for subclasses.

class ProgramLocationTableColumn(metaclass=ABCMeta):
