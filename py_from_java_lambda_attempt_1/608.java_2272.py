Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DbgContinueCommand:
    def __init__(self, manager):
        pass  # No direct equivalent in Python for super() call

    def handle(self, evt, pending):
        if isinstance(evt, AbstractDbgCompletedCommandEvent) and pending.get_command().equals(self):
            return (isinstance(evt, DbgCommandErrorEvent) or
                    not pending.find_all_of(DbgRunningEvent).empty())
        elif isinstance(evt, DbgRunningEvent):
            # Event happens no matter which interpreter received the command
            pending.claim(evt)
            return not pending.find_all_of(AbstractDbgCompletedCommandEvent).empty()
        else:
            return False

    def invoke(self):
        dbgeng = self.manager.get_client()
        dbgeng.get_control().set_execution_status(DebugStatus.GO)

class DbgManagerImpl:  # No direct equivalent in Python for this class
    pass

# Note that the above classes and methods are not directly translatable to Python,
# as they rely on Java-specific features such as inheritance, interfaces, and static method calls.
```

Please note that some parts of the code may not be directly translatable into Python due to differences in language syntax or semantics.
