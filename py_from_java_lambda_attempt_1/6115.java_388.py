Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Licensed under Apache License 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

class AbstractCompositeBitFieldTest:
    C_SOURCE_FILE = 'ghidra/app/util/cparser/bitfields.h'

    def setUp(self):
        super().setUp()
        self.parse_c_header_file(C_SOURCE_FILE)

    def parse_c_header_file(self, file_name):
        # Implement the logic to parse the given c header file
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    AbstractCompositeBitFieldTest().setUp()

```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `@Before` and `abstract class`. In this translation, I've used a regular class with an overridden method for setup. The test case is also simplified as there isn't any JUnit testing framework in Python.
