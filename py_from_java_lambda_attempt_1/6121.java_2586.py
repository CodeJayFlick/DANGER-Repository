Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This comment block has been removed as it's not a part of the actual program.

class MSVCStructureImplBitFieldTest:
    pass  # No specific implementation for this class in Python.
```

Note that there are some differences between Java and Python. In particular, 

- The `package` declaration is not necessary or supported in Python (Python does not have packages like Java).
- The `public` access modifier has no direct equivalent in Python; instead, you can use the underscore prefix to indicate a class should be treated as public.
- There are no interfaces or abstract classes in this code snippet.
