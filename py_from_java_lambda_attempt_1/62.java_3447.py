Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This is a comment block in Python, similar to Java's /* */ comments.
# It does not affect the execution of your program.

class DebuggerMakeBreakpointsEffectiveActionContext:
    # Nothing to add (similar to Java's empty class)
    pass

```

Please note that this translation is quite straightforward. The equivalent Python code for a Java package declaration (`package ghidra.app.plugin.core.debug.gui.breakpoint;`) does not exist in Python, as it has no direct equivalent.
