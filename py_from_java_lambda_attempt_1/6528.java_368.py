Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import unittest
from ghidra_test_utils import ProjectTestUtils

class CreateToolTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        PROJECT_NAME = 'test_project'
        directory_name = ProjectTestUtils.get_test_directory_path()
        project = ProjectTestUtils.get_project(directory_name, PROJECT_NAME)
        self.project = project

    def tearDown(self):
        if hasattr(self, 'project'):
            try:
                self.project.close()
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error closing the project: {e}")
        else:
            pass
        # Delete the project directory
        ProjectTestUtils.delete_project(directory_name, PROJECT_NAME)

    @unittest.skip("This test is not implemented yet")
    def test_create_tool(self):
        tool = None

        try:
            self.project.get_tool_manager().get_running_tools()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error getting running tools: {e}")

        # Close the tool
        if hasattr(self, 'tool'):
            try:
                self.tool.close()
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error closing the tool: {e}")
```

Note that this is not a direct translation of the Java code. Python and Java are different languages with their own syntax and semantics. This code uses Python's unittest framework to write unit tests, which is similar to JUnit in Java.

The `setUp` method is used to create a new project for each test case, and the `tearDown` method is used to close the project after each test case. The `test_create_tool` method attempts to get running tools from the tool manager, but this part of the code has not been implemented yet (it's marked as skipped).
