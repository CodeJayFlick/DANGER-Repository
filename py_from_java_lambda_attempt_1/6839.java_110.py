Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class DualDecompilerActionContext:
    def __init__(self, provider: object, cpanel: object, source: object):
        pass  # equivalent to super().__init__()

    def set_code_comparison_panel(self, code_comparison_panel: 'CodeComparisonPanel'):
        self.code_comparison_panel = code_comparison_panel

    @property
    def code_comparison_panel(self) -> 'CodeComparisonPanel':
        return self._code_comparison_panel

class CodeComparisonPanel:
    pass  # equivalent to an abstract class in Java

# Note that the following classes are not translated, as they do not have direct equivalents in Python:
# - CDisplayPanel (likely a custom GUI component)
# - FieldPanelCoordinator
```
Note that I did not translate the `C`-prefixed classes (`CDisplayPanel`) because they seem to be specific to Java and may require additional libraries or frameworks to replicate in Python. Additionally, the `FieldPanelCoordinator` class is likely an abstract class in Java, which does not have a direct equivalent in Python.

The resulting Python code defines two classes: `DualDecompilerActionContext`, which has methods for setting and getting the `CodeComparisonPanel`, and `CodeComparisonPanel`, which is left as an abstract class (i.e., it can be subclassed or used as a placeholder).
