Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class DbgExceptionEvent:
    def __init__(self, info):
        super().__init__(info)
```
Note that I've kept the class name and method names identical to their Java counterparts, as they are descriptive and easy to understand. The `super()` call is used to invoke the constructor of the parent class (`AbstractDbgEvent`), which is not shown in this code snippet.

Also, Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `package` statement or import statements for classes from other packages. Instead, you would typically use relative imports (e.g., `from .agent dbgeng`) if you were working within the same package hierarchy, or absolute imports (e.g., `import agent.dbgeng.debugexceptionrecord64`) if you needed to access a class from another package.

However, since this is just an example translation and not part of a larger codebase, I've omitted those details.
