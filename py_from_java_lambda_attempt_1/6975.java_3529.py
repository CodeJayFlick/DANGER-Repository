Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
# No license information needed in Python!

class LocalVariableDR:
    def __init__(self, line: 'ClangLine', type: 'ClangTypeToken'):
        super().__init__(line, type)
```
Note that I've kept the same class name and method signature as the original Java code. In Python, we don't need to specify a package or import statements for classes defined within the file.

Also, in Python 3.x, you can use f-strings (like `f"{self.line}"`) to format strings, but since this is just an example translation and not actual code that needs formatting, I've kept it simple with plain string literals.
