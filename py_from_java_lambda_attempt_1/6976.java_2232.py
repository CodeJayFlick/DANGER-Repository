Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
# No license information or boilerplate text in Python!

class ParameterDR:
    def __init__(self, line: 'ClangLine', token: 'ClangTypeToken'):
        super().__init__(line, token)
```
Note that I've kept the type hints for `line` and `token`, as they are useful for documentation purposes. However, in Python 3.x, you can remove these type hints if you prefer a more concise code.

Also, since there is no equivalent to Java's `package` statement in Python, I omitted it altogether.
