Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```python
class DbgRegisterSet:
    def __init__(self, regs):
        self.by_name = {}
        self.by_number = {}

        for r in regs:
            self.by_name[r.name] = r
            self.by_number[r.number] = r

    def get_by_name(self, name):
        return self.by_name.get(name)

    def get_by_number(self, number):
        return self.by_number.get(number)

    def __iter__(self):
        return iter(self.by_number.values())

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.by_number)
```
Note that I've used Python's built-in dictionary (`{}`) and set (`set()`) types to replace Java's `HashMap` and `TreeMap`. I've also replaced the `Collection<DbgRegister>` parameter with a simple list of `DbgRegister` objects. The rest of the code is straightforward translations from Java to Python.

Here are some specific notes on the translation:

* In Python, we don't need to specify types for variables or method parameters.
* We use dictionaries (`{}`) instead of maps (Java's equivalent).
* We use sets (`set()`) instead of abstract sets (Java's equivalent).
* The `iterator()` and `size()` methods are replaced with the built-in `__iter__` and `__len__` special methods, which Python uses to implement iteration and length calculation.
* I've used simple attribute accessors (`self.by_name[r.name] = r`) instead of Java-style method calls.
