Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class HardFailLogMode:
    k_Log_None = 0
    k_Log_Verbose = 1
    k_Log_Warning = 2
    k_Log_Internal_Fatal = 3

# Note: Enums in Python are not exactly like enums in Java. Here, we're using a class with integer values to simulate the same functionality.
```

Please note that this is just an equivalent translation and may not be identical due to differences between languages.
