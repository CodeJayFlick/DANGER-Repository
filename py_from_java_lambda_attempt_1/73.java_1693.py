Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class LogRowConsoleActionContext:
    pass
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `package` statement, so I omitted it. Also, since this is just an empty class definition, there isn't much to translate beyond removing the Java-specific syntax and adding some comments about the Apache License (which applies equally well to Python code).
