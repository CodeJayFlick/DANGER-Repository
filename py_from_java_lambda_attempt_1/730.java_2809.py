Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class DbgExitNormallyReason:
    def __init__(self):
        # Nothing additional to parse
        pass

    def desc(self) -> str:
        return "Exited normally"
```

Note that in this translation, I have removed the `Map< String, Object >` parameter from the constructor as it is not directly equivalent to a Python concept. If you want to add some information to your class instance, you would typically use an attribute or properties (in Python 3.8+).
