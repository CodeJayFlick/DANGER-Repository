Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import os
from collections import defaultdict

class FindErrors:
    def run(self):
        folder = input("Please select a project folder: ")
        
        programs = []
        self.find_programs(programs, folder)
        results = {}
        for program in programs:
            try:
                errors = len(os.listdir(f"{program}/bookmarks/ERROR"))
                results[program] = errors
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"problem looking at {program}: {e}")
        
        sorted_results = dict(sorted(results.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))
        for program, error_count in sorted_results.items():
            print(f"{program}: {error_count}")

    def find_programs(self, programs, folder):
        files = os.listdir(folder)
        for file in files:
            if monitor.is_cancelled():  # This line is not defined
                return
            if file.endswith(".ghidra"):  # Assuming this is the extension of program files
                programs.append(file)
        
        folders = [f for f in os.listdir(folder) if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(folder, f))]
        for folder in folders:
            self.find_programs(programs, os.path.join(folder))

# Initialize monitor and start running script
monitor = None  # This line is not defined
script = FindErrors()
script.run()

```

Please note that this Python code does not exactly replicate the Java code. The original Java code seems to be a part of Ghidra's scripting API, which provides specific functionality for working with binary files and program analysis. In contrast, the provided Python code is more general-purpose and may require additional libraries or modifications to achieve similar results.

Also note that some parts of the original Java code are not directly translatable into Python due to differences in syntax and semantics between the two languages. For example:

1. The `Pair` class used in the original Java code does not have a direct equivalent in Python.
2. The `monitor` object is not defined or utilized properly in this translation, as it seems to be specific to Ghidra's scripting API.

To better replicate the functionality of the original Java code, you may need to use libraries like `pathlib`, `os`, and `collections` for file system operations, and possibly other specialized libraries depending on your specific requirements.
