Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class FidHasher:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def hash(self, func: 'Function') -> tuple or None:
        """
        Computes the hash for a given function.
        
        Args:
            func (Function): The function to hash
        
        Returns:
            tuple or None: A 4-tuple of hashes if successful, otherwise None
        Raises:
            MemoryAccessException: If there are inaccessible code units in the function body
        """
        # Implement your logic here. For example,
        return ((func.get_code_unit_1(), func.get_code_unit_2()), (func.get_code_unit_3(), func.get_code_unit_4()))
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface concept, so we are using a class instead. Also, the `@param` and `@return` comments were removed as they serve no purpose in Python code.

The method signature is similar to the original Java code, with the addition of type hints for clarity. The return value is now a tuple (or None) which represents all 4 hashes at once.
