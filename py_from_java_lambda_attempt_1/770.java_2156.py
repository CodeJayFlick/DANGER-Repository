Here is the translation of the Java interface `DbgModelTargetModuleContainer` to a Python class:

```python
import asyncio

class DbgModelTargetModuleContainer:
    def add_synthetic_module(self, name):
        # This method returns a coroutine that resolves to a TargetModule.
        # In Python, we can't directly translate this into an equivalent CompletableFuture,
        # so we'll just return None for now. You may want to implement your own
        # asynchronous mechanism if needed.
        return asyncio.coroutine(None)

    def get_target_module(self, name):
        pass  # Return the target module with the given name

    async def library_loaded(self, name):
        pass  # Handle a library being loaded

    async def library_unloaded(self, name):
        pass  # Handle a library being unloaded
```

Note that Python doesn't have direct equivalents to Java's `CompletableFuture` or `@Override`, so we've made some simplifications and adjustments in the translation.
