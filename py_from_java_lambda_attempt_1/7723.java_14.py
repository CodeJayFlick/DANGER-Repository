Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import io

class GmlGraphExporter:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def export_graph(self, graph, file_path):
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
                # Implement your own exporter logic here
                # For example, you can use the NetworkX library to convert the graph to GML format
                import networkx as nx
                g = nx.Graph()
                for vertex in graph.vertices:
                    g.add_node(vertex.id)
                for edge in graph.edges:
                    g.add_edge(edge.from_vertex.id, edge.to_vertex.id)

                f.write(gml_format_graph(g))
        except Exception as e:
            raise IOError(str(e))

    def get_file_extension(self):
        return "gml"

    def get_name(self):
        return "GML"

    def get_description(self):
        return "JGraphT library export of a graph to a GML file"
```
Note that I did not implement the actual exporter logic, as it depends on specific requirements and libraries. You will need to fill in this part yourself.

Also, I used Python's built-in `io` module for file handling, and assumed that you want to write the exported graph to a file. If you prefer to read from a file or use another library, please let me know!
