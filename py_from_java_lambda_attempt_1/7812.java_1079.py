Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MDUnionType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_type_name(self) -> str:
        return "union"
```

Note that in this translation, I have removed some parts which are not directly translatable to Python. For example, the `MDMang` class and its usage is not present in Java code but it seems like a custom class for managing something related to Microsoft mangled symbols. Similarly, there was no direct equivalent of Java's "package" concept in Python so I have removed that part as well.
