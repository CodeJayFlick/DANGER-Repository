Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MDBoolDataType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_type_name(self) -> str:
        return "bool"
```

Note that this is a simplified version, as there are some differences between Java and Python. For example, in the original Java code, `MDMang` was imported from another package, but since we don't have any information about what `MDMang` does or where it's defined, I omitted those parts for simplicity.
