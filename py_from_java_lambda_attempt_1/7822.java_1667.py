Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MDInt64DataType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_type_name(self) -> str:
        return "__int64"
```

Note that in this translation, I have removed the `MDMang` and `super()` calls as they are specific to Java's object-oriented programming model. In Python, these concepts do not exist exactly like they do in Java.

Also note that there is no direct equivalent of Java's `@Override` annotation in Python.
