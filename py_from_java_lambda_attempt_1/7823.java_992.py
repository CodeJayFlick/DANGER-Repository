Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MDInt8DataType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_type_name(self) -> str:
        return "__int8"
```

Note that this Python class does not include any reference to `MDMang` or `super()` as these are Java-specific constructs. The equivalent functionality in Python would be achieved through the use of constructors and instance variables, but it is not necessary for a simple data type like an integer with 8 bits.

Also note that there's no direct translation of Java's "package" declaration to Python. In Python, you can simply define your class without any package declaration.
