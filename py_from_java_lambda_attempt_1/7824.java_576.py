Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MDUnknownPExtendedDataType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_type_name(self) -> str:
        return "UNKNOWN"
```

Note that in this translation, I have removed some parts which are not necessary for a simple class definition.
