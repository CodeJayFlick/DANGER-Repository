Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class MDShortDataType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_type_name(self) -> str:
        return "short"
```

Note that in this translation, I have removed some parts of the original code as they are not directly translatable to Python. The `MDMang` class and its methods do not exist in Python, so it was removed from the translated code.
