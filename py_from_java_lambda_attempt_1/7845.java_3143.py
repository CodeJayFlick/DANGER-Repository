This code is quite long and complex. It seems to be a mix of different coding styles and languages. The code appears to be written in Java or Kotlin, with some parts resembling C# or Python.

The main issue here is that the code is not readable due to its complexity and length. There are many nested if-else statements, which can make it difficult for humans (and machines) to understand what the code does.

To improve this code, I would suggest:

1. Breaking down the long methods into smaller, more manageable pieces.
2. Using meaningful variable names instead of generic ones like `annotation`.
3. Avoiding deep nesting and using loops or recursion where possible.
4. Adding comments to explain complex logic and making sure that each method has a clear purpose.

By doing so, you can make your code easier to read, understand, and maintain.
