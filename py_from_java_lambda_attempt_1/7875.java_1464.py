Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python

class MDMangVS2013:
    """An MDMang extension that tailors output to Visual Studio 2013 (and earlier?) output results."""

    def allow_cv_mod_l_ref_r_ref(self):
        return False
```

Note: Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `package` and `public class`, as it uses modules instead.
