Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This class represents a Microsoft C++ RTTI3 internal structure.
class MDRTTI3:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # Not doing any additional work at this time, but this separate object is being created for future extension.

def main():
    print("This is the Python translation of Java code.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that there are some significant differences between Java and Python. For example:

- In Java, you need to explicitly define classes with `class` keyword whereas in Python, it's not necessary.
- In Java, you have separate keywords for class definition (`public`, `private`) but in Python, these concepts don't exist at the language level; they are enforced by conventions and frameworks (like Flask or Django).
- In Java, there is no equivalent to Python's `pass` statement.
