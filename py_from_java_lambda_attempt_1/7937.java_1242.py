Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This class tests a demangler that is derived from MDMang using tests codified in MDMangBaseTest.
class MDemanglerGhidraTest:
    def __init__(self):
        self.test_configuration = MDGhidraTestConfiguration(be_quiet())

def be_quiet():
    # Add your implementation here
    pass

# This class is a configuration for testing the demangler. It should have methods and attributes similar to those in MDMangBaseTest.
class MDGhidraTestConfiguration:
    def __init__(self, quiet):
        self.quiet = quiet
```

Please note that Python does not support direct translation of Java code into equivalent Python code because both languages are quite different. The above Python code is an approximation based on the given Java code and may need to be modified according to your specific requirements.
