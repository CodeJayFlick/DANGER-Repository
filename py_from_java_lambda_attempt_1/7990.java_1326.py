Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class Hasher32:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def hash(self, string: str, unsigned_32_bit_mod: int) -> int:
        return self.hash_string_32(string, unsigned_32_bit_mod)

    def hash_string_32(self, string: str, unsigned_32_bit_mod: int) -> int:
        # implement the actual hashing algorithm here
        pass

# Example usage:
hasher = Hasher32()
result = hasher.hash("example", 0xffffffff)
print(result)
```
Note that I did not include any implementation for the `hash_string_32` method, as it was left blank in the original Java code. You would need to implement a suitable hashing algorithm (e.g., using Python's built-in `hash()` function or implementing your own) and replace the `pass` statement with the actual implementation.

Also, I used type hints for the function parameters and return values, which is not strictly necessary but can help with readability and static analysis.
