Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DbgModelTargetDebugContainerImpl:
    def __init__(self, process):
        self.process = process
        self.breakpoints = DbgModelTargetBreakpointContainer(self)
        self.events = DbgModelTargetEventContainer(self)
        self.exceptions = DbgModelTargetExceptionContainer(self)

    # Other methods and attributes can be added here

class DbgModelTargetBreakpointContainer:
    def __init__(self, container):
        self.container = container

class DbgModelTargetEventContainer:
    def __init__(self, container):
        self.container = container

class DbgModelTargetExceptionContainer:
    def __init__(self, container):
        self.container = container
```

Note that this is a simplified translation and does not include all the details of the original Java code. The Python version lacks some attributes (like `canonicalContainer`) and methods (`changeAttributes`), as well as imports from other classes or modules.
