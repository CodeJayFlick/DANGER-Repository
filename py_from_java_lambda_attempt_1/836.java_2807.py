Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AbstractDbgengModelHost:
    def get_factory_options(self):
        return {}
```

Note that in this translation:

- The `package` declaration has been removed as it's not necessary in Python.
- The `import` statements have also been removed, as they are used to import Java classes and aren't needed for a direct equivalent Python code.
