Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AbstractModelForDbgengScenarioCloneExitTest:
    def get_specimen(self):
        return "CREATE_THREAD_EXIT"

    def get_breakpoint_expression(self):
        return "!work"
```

Note that this is a simplified version, as Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's abstract classes and methods. Also, the `WindowsSpecimen` class in the original code has been replaced with a simple string constant `"CREATE_THREAD_EXIT"` since there is no equivalent concept in Python.
