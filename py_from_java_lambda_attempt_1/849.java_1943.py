Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AbstractModelForDbgengSessionActivationTest:
    def get_activatable_things(self):
        return None  # TODO: Don't know how to make multiple sessions


# This class doesn't have a direct equivalent in Python, so it's not included here.
```

Note that the `@Override` annotation is specific to Java and has no direct equivalent in Python. The method signature also differs slightly between the two languages.

Also note that this code does not include any of the imports or other elements from the original Java file, as these are not directly translatable into Python.
