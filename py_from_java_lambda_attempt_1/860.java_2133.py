Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class GadpModelForDbgengRootLauncherTest:
    def model_host(self):
        return GadpDbgengModelHost()

class AbstractModelForDbgengRootLauncherTest:
    pass

class GadpDbgengModelHost:
    pass
```
Note that I did not translate the Java imports, as Python does not have a direct equivalent. Instead, you would need to import any necessary modules or classes in your Python code.

Also, keep in mind that this is just one possible translation of the Java code to Python - there may be other ways to achieve the same result using different Python syntax and structures.
