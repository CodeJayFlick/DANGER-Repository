Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class InVmModelForDbgengProcessActivationTest:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_process_pattern(self):
        return "Sessions[0].Processes[]"

    def model_host(self) -> 'InVmDbgengModelHost':
        from . import InVmDbgengModelHost
        return InVmDbgengModelHost()

    def get_expected_session_path(self):
        return ["Sessions[0]"]

    def id_from_capture(self, line: str) -> str:
        parts = line.split()
        if len(parts) > 1:
            return parts[1]
        else:
            return ""
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's PathPattern and PathUtils classes. In the above code, I've used string literals to represent the path patterns as they are simpler in Python.

Also, please note that this is a simple translation and may require additional work depending on your specific requirements.
