Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class InVmModelForDbgengScenarioForkExitTest:
    def test_scenario(self):
        pass  # This method does nothing currently.

    def model_host(self):
        return InVmDbgengModelHost()
```

Note that in this translation, the `@Ignore` and `@Test` annotations from Java are not directly equivalent to Python. The `test_scenario` function is defined as a regular instance method of the class, but it does nothing currently because its body (`pass`) simply returns control without doing anything.

The `model_host` method has been translated into an instance method with no changes in functionality.
