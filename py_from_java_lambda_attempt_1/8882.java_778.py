This is an example of how you can use the `@Override` annotation to specify that your method overrides another method in a superclass. The code snippet above shows several methods with this annotation, each overriding a corresponding method in its superclass.

In Java, when you override a method from a superclass, you must provide an implementation for that method. This is because the overridden method may be called by other parts of your program or even by external classes that rely on it being implemented correctly.

The `@Override` annotation helps to ensure that you are actually overriding a method and not just declaring one with the same name as in the superclass. It also serves as documentation, indicating which method is being overridden.

Here's an example of how you can use this annotation:

```java
public class Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("The animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have an `Animal` class with a method called `sound`. We then create a subclass of `Dog`, which overrides this method using the `@Override` annotation. This indicates that our new implementation is replacing the original one from the superclass.

Remember to use the `@Override` annotation whenever you override a method in your Java code, as it helps ensure correctness and provides documentation for other developers working with your code.
