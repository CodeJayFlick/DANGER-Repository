Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class ComparableConcept:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def compare_objects(self, context_object: 'ModelObject', other_object: 'ModelObject') -> int:
        """A wrapper for IComparableConcept and its newer variants."""
        # Your implementation here
        return 0


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Concept(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def __init__(self):
        pass


class ModelObject:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface or class. In this translation, I used a regular class `ComparableConcept` to represent the concept in your code. The method `compare_objects` is defined with type hints for clarity and compatibility with static analysis tools like mypy.

The abstract base class `Concept` represents an abstract concept that must be implemented by any concrete subclass.
