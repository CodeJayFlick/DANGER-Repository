Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class FilterSettings:
    SHOW_ALL = "Show All"
    SHOW_UNMATCHED = "Show Unmatched"
    SHOW_UNACCEPTED = "Show Unaccepted"

# Usage example:
print(FilterSettings.SHOW_ALL)  # prints: Show All
```

Please note that in Python, we don't have an equivalent to Java's `enum` type. Instead, we can use a class with constant variables as shown above.
