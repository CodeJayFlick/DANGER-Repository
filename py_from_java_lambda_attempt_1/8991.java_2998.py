Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python code:

```Python
class MarkupItemFilterDialogComponentProvider:
    def __init__(self, controller, dialog_model):
        super().__init__()
        self.controller = controller
        self.dialog_model = dialog_model
        self.set_help_location("VersionTrackingPlugin", "Markup_Filters")

    def build_filter_panel(self):
        row_one_panel = JPanel()
        row_one_panel.setLayout(BoxLayout(row_one_panel, BoxLayout.X_AXIS))

        # status filter
        status_filter = MarkupStatusFilter()
        self.add_filter(status_filter)
        row_one_panel.add(status_filter.get_component())

        # markup type
        type_filter = MarkupTypeFilter()
        self.add_filter(type_filter)
        row_one_panel.add(type_filter.get_component())

        return row_one_panel

class JPanel:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def set_layout(self, layout):
        pass

    def add(self, component):
        pass

class BoxLayout:
    X_AXIS = 0
    Y_AXIS = 1

    def __init__(self, panel, axis):
        self.panel = panel
        self.axis = axis

    def get_panel(self):
        return self.panel

    def set_axis(self, axis):
        self.axis = axis

class MarkupStatusFilter:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_component(self):
        pass

class MarkupTypeFilter:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_component(self):
        pass
```

Please note that this is a direct translation of the Java code into Python, and it may not be exactly equivalent. For example:

- In Java, `JPanel` is a class from Swing library which provides functionality for creating panels in GUI applications. In Python, we can create our own panel class or use an existing one like `tkinter.Frame`.
- The `BoxLayout` class in Java does not have direct equivalent in Python's tkinter library. We would need to implement custom layout management.
- Similarly, the filters (`MarkupStatusFilter`, `MarkupTypeFilter`) are also implemented as classes with methods that return components, but their actual implementation is missing from this translation.

Also note that there might be some syntax errors or issues due to differences in Java and Python programming languages.
