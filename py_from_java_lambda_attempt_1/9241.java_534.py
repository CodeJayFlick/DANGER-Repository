Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class RecordNode:
    def get_record_offset(self, index):
        # Add your implementation here.
        pass  # Replace with actual logic.

    def get_key_offset(self, index):
        # Add your implementation here.
        pass  # Replace with actual logic.
```

Note that this is a direct translation of the Java interface into Python. The methods in the class are defined as abstract because they do not have any implementations (i.e., their bodies are empty). You would need to add your own code within these method definitions to make them functional.

Also, note that there's no equivalent for `throws IOException` in Python. Instead of explicitly declaring exceptions like you do in Java, Python uses a try-except block to catch and handle exceptions at runtime.
