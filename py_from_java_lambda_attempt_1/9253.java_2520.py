Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class ErrorHandler:
    """Report database errors."""

    def db_error(self, e: Exception):
        """Notification that an IO exception occurred."""
        pass  # Implement your error handling logic here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        raise IOException("Error")
    except Exception as e:
        eh = ErrorHandler()
        eh.db_error(e)
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we define a class with methods that can be implemented by subclasses or used directly if the class is instantiated.

Also, in Python, exceptions are raised using the `raise` statement and caught using try-except blocks. The `IOException` exception is replaced with the built-in `Exception` type, as there is no direct equivalent to Java's `java.io.IOException`.
