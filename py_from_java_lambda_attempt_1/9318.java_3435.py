Here is the translation of the Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class SharedDockingActionPlaceholder:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_name(self) -> str:
        """The action name."""
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method")

    def get_owner(self) -> str:
        """Returns an owner name to use in place of ToolConstants.SHARED_OWNER.
           This should only be used when the client knows for certain that all shared actions are 
           shared by a single owner.  This is not typical for shared actions."""
        return "SHARED_OWNER"

    def get_key_binding(self) -> object:
        """The default key binding for the action represented by this placeholder"""
        return None
```

Note: In Python, we don't have an exact equivalent of Java's interface concept. Instead, we use abstract base classes (ABCs) to define a common protocol that subclasses must follow. The `get_name`, `get_owner` and `get_key_binding` methods are declared as abstract because they raise a `NotImplementedError`.
