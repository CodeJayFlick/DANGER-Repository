Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

class DockingContextListener:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    # Called when the context changes
    def context_changed(self, context):
        pass


```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface concept. In Python, you can achieve similar functionality using abstract base classes (ABCs) or protocols from third-party libraries like `typing`. However, for simplicity and to maintain the original structure of your code, I used a regular class in this translation.
