Here is the translation of the Java interface `FocusOwnerProvider` to a Python class:

```python
class FocusOwnerProvider:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_focus_owner(self) -> object:
        """Returns the current focus owner"""
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method")

    def get_active_window(self) -> object:
        """Returns the active window"""
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method")
```

Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we define an abstract base class (ABC) using the `abc` module or by defining a class with all methods declared as abstract (`NotImplementedError`). In this case, I've used the latter approach.

Also, since Python doesn't have a built-in concept of "active window" like Java does, I've left that method signature vague and up to the subclass implementation.
