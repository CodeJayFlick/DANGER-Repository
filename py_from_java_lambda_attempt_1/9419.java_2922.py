Here is the translation of the Java interface `ManagedMenuItem` into a Python class:

```python
class ManagedMenuItem:
    def get_group(self):
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass

    def get_subgroup(self):
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass

    def get_menu_item_text(self):
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass

    @property
    def menu_item(self):
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass (returns a JMenuItem or Menu)

    def dispose(self):
        pass  # Implement this method to release resources used by the object

    def remove_action(self, action: 'DockingActionIf') -> bool:
        return False  # Default implementation; implement this method in your subclass if needed

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        return True  # Default implementation; implement this method in your subclass if needed
```

Note that I've used Python's `pass` statement to indicate where the implementing class should provide its own implementation. This is equivalent to Java's abstract methods, which must be implemented by any concrete subclass.

I've also translated the Java `JMenuItem` type into a Python property called `menu_item`, since there isn't an exact equivalent in Python for Java's interface types or method return values.
