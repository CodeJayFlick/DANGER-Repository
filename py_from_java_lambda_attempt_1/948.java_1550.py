Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class KeyEnumerator:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def reset(self):
        # Add your implementation here
        pass

    def get_next(self) -> str:
        # Add your implementation here
        return ""

    def get_value(self) -> object:
        # Add your implementation here
        return None
```

Note that the `UnknownEx` class and its methods are not directly translatable to Python, as they seem to be specific to Java. In this translation, I have replaced them with a simple placeholder (`pass`) for now. You would need to implement these methods according to your requirements in the actual code.
