Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class DropdownSelectionChoiceListener:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def selection_changed(self, t: object) -> None:
        """A listener that is called when the user makes a selection from 
           the DropDownSelectionTextField (e.g., they click an item or press enter on a selected 
           item and the matching window is closed).
        
        Args:
            t (object): The type of objects used by the field.
        """
        pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct support for generics like Java, so I've removed the `<T>` part. Also, in Python, we don't need to specify return types or parameter types explicitly unless it's necessary for clarity.
