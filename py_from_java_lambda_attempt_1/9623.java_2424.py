Here is the translation of the Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class GhidraFileChooserDirectoryModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.selected_file = None

    def set_selected_file(self, file: str) -> None:
        if isinstance(file, str):
            self.selected_file = file
        else:
            raise TypeError("File must be a string")

    def get_selected_file(self) -> str | None:
        return self.selected_file

    def get_selected_rows(self) -> list[int]:
        # This method is not implemented in the original Java interface.
        # It's assumed that this class doesn't need to handle selected rows
        return []

    def get_file(self, row: int) -> str | None:
        if isinstance(row, int):
            return self.selected_file  # Assuming there's only one file
        else:
            raise TypeError("Row must be an integer")

    def edit(self) -> None:
        pass  # This method is not implemented in the original Java interface.
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of interfaces like Java. Instead, we can use abstract classes or protocols to define a set of methods that need to be implemented by any class that inherits from it. In this case, I've used an ordinary class with placeholder implementations for each method in the original interface.
