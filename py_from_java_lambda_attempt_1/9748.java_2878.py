Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class InRangeColumnConstraint:
    def __init__(self, name: str = "In Range", min_value: object, max_value: object, editor_provider):
        super().__init__(name, min_value, max_value, editor_provider)

    @property
    def accepts(self) -> bool:
        if value is None:
            return False
        return (value >= self.min_value and value <= self.max_value)

    def copy(self, min: object, max: object):
        return InRangeColumnConstraint(self.name, min, max, self.editor_provider)
```
Note that I've made the following changes:

* Renamed `public` to nothing, as Python doesn't have a equivalent concept.
* Replaced Java-style comments with Python's triple quotes (`"""`) for docstrings and inline comments.
* Changed method signatures to use Python's syntax (e.g., no need for explicit return types).
* Removed the `<T extends Comparable<T>>` type parameter, as Python is dynamically typed and doesn't require explicit type parameters.
* Replaced Java-style string concatenation with f-strings or `str.format()` if needed.

Also note that I've assumed some classes (`RangeColumnConstraint`, `EditorProvider`) are defined elsewhere in the codebase. If these classes don't exist, you'll need to define them as well.
