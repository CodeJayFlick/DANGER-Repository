Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import threading

class FilterJob(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, model, monitor):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = model
        self.monitor = monitor

# Note: The type parameter <T> in Java does not have a direct equivalent in Python.
# In this translation, I assume that the `model` and `monitor` variables are of some custom class types,
# but you can modify them to be any type or object as needed.

# Also note that there is no built-in concept of "TaskMonitor" in Python like it exists in Java's ghidra.util.task package.
# In this translation, I assume that the `monitor` variable will be used for some other purpose,
# but you can modify it to be any type or object as needed.

```
Please note that there are significant differences between Java and Python.
