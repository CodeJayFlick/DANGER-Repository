Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import threading

class TestIncrementalThreadedTableModelListener:
    def __init__(self, model, spy):
        super().__init__(model, spy)

    def reset(self, model):
        super().reset(model)
        # sometimes the test changes the model--this allows us to listen to the latest model
        model.add_listener(self)
```
Note that I did not include any imports for `ghidra` or `docking`, as they are likely specific to the GHIDRA reverse engineering tool and may require additional setup or configuration. The code above is a straightforward translation of the Java code to Python, using the built-in `threading` module for thread-related functionality (although it's not clear what this would be used for in this context).
