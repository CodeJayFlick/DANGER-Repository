Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
from weakref import WeakValueDictionary as WeakValueHashMap

class DataModelScriptTemplateEnumeratorInternal:
    CACHE = WeakValueHashMap()

    @classmethod
    def instance_for(cls, data):
        return cls.lazy_weak_cache(cls.CACHE, data)

    PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS_BUILDER = {}
    PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS = {}

    @classmethod
    def try_preferred_interfaces(cls, supplier):
        return DbgModelUtil.try_preferred_interfaces(DataModelScriptTemplateEnumeratorInternal, 
            cls.PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS, supplier)

# This is a placeholder for the Java class methods. You would need to implement these in Python.
class DbgModelUtil:
    @classmethod
    def lazy_weak_cache(cls, cache, data):
        pass

    @classmethod
    def try_preferred_interfaces(cls, cls_, preferred_iids, supplier):
        pass
```

Please note that the above code is not a direct translation of Java to Python. It's more like an equivalent implementation in Python. The `DbgModelUtil` class methods are placeholders and would need to be implemented according to your requirements.
