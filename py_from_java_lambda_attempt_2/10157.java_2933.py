Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import weakref
from collections import defaultdict

class ConcurrentListenerSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.storage = defaultdict(weakref.ref)

    def add(self, t):
        self.storage[t] = None  # use default value as a placeholder

    def remove(self, t):
        del self.storage[t]

    def clear(self):
        self.storage.clear()

    def iterator(self):
        return iter(self.storage.keys())

    def as_list(self):
        return list(self.storage.keys())
```

Note that Python does not have an exact equivalent to Java's `ConcurrentHashMap`. However, we can use a dictionary with default values and the `weakref` module for weak references. This implementation is similar in spirit to the original Java code but may behave slightly differently due to differences between languages.
