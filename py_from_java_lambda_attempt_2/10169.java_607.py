Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python equivalent:

```Python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

class QRunnable(Generic[I]):
    def run(self, item: I, monitor=None) -> None:
        pass  # This method should be implemented by subclasses.
```

In this code, we define a class `QRunnable` that is generic in the type variable `I`. The `run` method takes an object of type `I` and an optional `monitor`, which defaults to `None`.
