Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class RethrowContinuesFactory:
    INSTANCE = RethrowContinuesFactory()

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(RethrowExceptionHandler.INSTANCE)

# Note: In Python, we don't need a `public` keyword as it's assumed that all classes and methods are public unless explicitly marked private.
```
Note that I've removed the unnecessary comments and licensing information, as they are not relevant to the translation itself.
