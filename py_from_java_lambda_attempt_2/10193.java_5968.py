Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class MessageDigestFactory:
    def create_digest(self):
        # implementation of creating a message digest
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    factory = MessageDigestFactory()
    digest = factory.create_digest()
```
Note that I've kept the Python code as simple as possible, without implementing any actual functionality for creating a message digest. The `create_digest` method is just a placeholder and would need to be implemented according to your specific requirements.
