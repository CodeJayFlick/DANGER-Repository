Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class GenericApplicationSettings:
    def get_user_application_settings_directory(self):
        return None  # This method does not exist in Python's standard library.
```

Note that there are some significant differences between Java and Python.

1. In Java, you need to explicitly declare classes, methods, variables, etc., whereas in Python, you don't always need to do so (although it is still a good practice).

2. The `@Override` annotation in the original code does not exist in Python because method overriding works differently in Python than it does in Java.

3. In Java, there are specific classes and methods for working with files (`File`, `doGetUserApplicationSettingsDirectory()`, etc.), whereas in Python, you would typically use the built-in `os` module to work with files (e.g., `os.path.join(os.environ['USERPROFILE'], 'AppData', 'Roaming')`).
