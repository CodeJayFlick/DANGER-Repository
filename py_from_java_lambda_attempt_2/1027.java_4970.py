Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from weakref import WeakValueDictionary as WeakValueHashMap
import immutable

class DebugHostContextInternal:
    _cache = WeakValueHashMap()

    @classmethod
    def instance_for(cls, data):
        return cls._lazy_weak_cache(_cache, data)

    PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS_BUILDER = immutable.Map.builder()
    PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS = PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS_BUILDER \
                                    .put((IDebugHostContext.IID_IDBUG_HOST_CONTEXT,), WrapIDebugHostContext) \
                                    .build()

    @classmethod
    def try_preferred_interfaces(cls, supplier):
        return cls._try_preferred_interfaces(DebugHostContextInternal, PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS, supplier)

# Helper methods

def _lazy_weak_cache(cache, data):
    # Implementation of lazyWeakCache method from Java code.
    pass

def _try_preferred_interfaces(cls, preferred_data_spaces_iids, supplier):
    # Implementation of tryPreferredInterfaces method from Java code.
    pass
```

Please note that the provided Python code is not a direct translation but rather an equivalent implementation in Python. The actual implementations for `_lazy_weak_cache` and `_try_preferred_interfaces` methods would depend on your specific requirements and use cases.

Also, please be aware of the following:

- In Java, `ImmutableMap.builder()` returns an instance that can be used to build a new immutable map.
  This is not directly available in Python. You might need to implement this functionality manually or using third-party libraries like `dicttools` for creating an equivalent builder pattern.

- The provided code does not include the actual implementations of `_lazy_weak_cache` and `_try_preferred_interfaces`. These methods would depend on your specific requirements and use cases.
