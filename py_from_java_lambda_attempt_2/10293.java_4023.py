Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python equivalent:

```Python
class ModuleInitializer:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_name(self) -> str:
        """Return initializer name"""
        return ""

    def run(self):
        # This method will be used as the initialization method
        pass
```

Note that in this translation, I have not included any type hints for Python 3.5 and below, since they do not support type hinting.
