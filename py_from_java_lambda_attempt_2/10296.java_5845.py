Here's a translation of the Java interface into equivalent Python:

```Python
class CustomOptionsEditor:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def get_option_names(self) -> list[str]:
        """Gets the names of the options that this editor is editing."""
        return []
    
    def get_option_descriptions(self) -> list[str]:
        """Gets the descriptions of the options that this editor is editing."""
        return []
```

Note: Python does not have direct equivalent to Java's interface concept. However, we can achieve similar functionality using abstract classes or protocols in other languages.
