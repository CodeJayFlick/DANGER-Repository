Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import collections

class TreeSetValuedTreeMap:
    def __init__(self):
        self._map = collections.defaultdict(collections.OrderedDict)

    def create_collection(self):
        return []

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        if key not in self._map:
            self._map[key] = []
        return self._map[key]

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if key not in self._map:
            self._map[key] = []
        self._map[key].append(value)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._map)
```
Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `TreeSet` and `AbstractSetValuedMap`, so I implemented the map as a dictionary with ordered dictionaries as values. The `create_collection()` method is replaced by an empty list, which can be used to store multiple values for each key.

Also, note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's generics (type parameters), but you can achieve similar behavior using duck typing and type hints. In this implementation, I did not use type hints as they are not strictly necessary in Python.
