Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import os
from collections import defaultdict

class ClassPackage:
    def __init__(self, root_dir, package_name):
        self.root_dir = root_dir
        self.package_name = package_name
        self.package_dir = os.path.join(root_dir, package_name.replace('.', os.sep))
        self.children = []
        self.classes = set()
        self.scan_classes()

    def scan_classes(self):
        for filename in os.listdir(self.package_dir):
            if filename.endswith('.class'):
                class_name = filename[:-6]
                if self.package_name:
                    class_name = f"{self.package_name}.{class_name}"
                # Load the class here
                pass

    def scan_sub_packages(self, monitor=None):
        subdirs = [f for f in os.listdir(self.package_dir) if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(self.package_dir, f))]
        if not subdirs:
            print(f"Directory does not exist: {self.package_dir}")
            return
        for subdir in subdirs:
            if '.' in subdir:
                continue  # Java can't handle dir names with '.'
            if self.package_name:
                pkg = f"{self.package_name}.{subdir}"
            else:
                pkg = subdir
            monitor.set_message(f"Scanning package: {pkg}")
            self.children.append(ClassPackage(self.root_dir, pkg))

    def get_classes(self):
        for c in list(self.classes):  # Make a copy to avoid modifying during iteration
            yield c

class ClassFinder:
    @classmethod
    def load_extension_point(cls, path, class_name):
        pass  # Load the extension point here

def main():
    root_dir = '/path/to/root/directory'
    package_names = ['package1', 'package2']
    for package_name in package_names:
        monitor = None  # You can implement a TaskMonitor-like object
        ClassPackage(package_name, root_dir).scan_sub_packages(monitor)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that the `load_extension_point` method is not implemented as it was part of the original Java code. Also, Python does not have direct equivalent to Java's `FileFilter`, so I used a simple list comprehension in the `scan_classes` and `scan_sub_packages` methods to filter out non-class files.
