Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
from weakref import WeakValueDictionary as CACHE
import collections

class DebugHostInternal:
    _CACHE = CACHE()

    @classmethod
    def instance_for(cls, data):
        return cls._lazy_weak_cache(data)

    @staticmethod
    def _lazy_weak_cache(cache, data, factory):
        if cache.get(data) is None:
            cache[data] = factory()
        return cache[data]

    PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS = collections.defaultdict(lambda: object)
    PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS[0x00000100] = WrapIDebugHost

    @classmethod
    def try_preferred_interfaces(cls, supplier):
        return cls._try_preferred_interfaces(supplier)

    @staticmethod
    def _try_preferred_interfaces(cls_, interfaces_dict, supplier):
        # This method is not implemented in the original code. It seems to be trying to find a preferred interface.
        pass

class WrapIDebugHost:
    pass

# You would need to implement these classes and methods based on your actual requirements
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `Map`, `ImmutableMap`, `Pointer`, `REFIID` or `InterfaceSupplier`. I've replaced them with Pythonic alternatives.
