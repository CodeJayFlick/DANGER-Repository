Here is the translation of the Java interface `KeyIndexableSet` to a Python class:

```python
class KeyIndexableSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.modification_number = 0
        self.keyed_objects = []

    def get_modification_number(self) -> int:
        return self.modification_number

    def size(self) -> int:
        return len(self.keyed_objects)

    def capacity(self) -> int:
        # This method is not implemented in the original Java code, so I'll leave it as a placeholder
        pass

    def add(self, o: 'KeyedObject') -> bool:
        if o is None or self.contains(o):
            return False
        self.keyed_objects.append(o)
        self.modification_number += 1
        return True

    def remove(self, o: 'KeyedObject') -> bool:
        try:
            self.keyed_objects.remove(o)
            self.modification_number += 1
            return True
        except ValueError:
            return False

    def contains(self, o: 'KeyedObject') -> bool:
        return o in self.keyed_objects

    def iterator(self) -> 'GraphIterator':
        # This method is not implemented in the original Java code, so I'll leave it as a placeholder
        pass

    def to_array(self) -> list:
        return [o for o in self.keyed_objects]

    def get_keyed_object(self, key: int) -> 'KeyedObject' | None:
        for obj in self.keyed_objects:
            if obj.get_key() == key:
                return obj
        return None

class KeyedObject:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # This class is not implemented in the original Java code, so I'll leave it as a placeholder

    def get_key(self) -> int:
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method")
```

Note that I've used Python's type hinting system to indicate the types of variables and function parameters. However, since Python is dynamically typed, these hints are not enforced at runtime.

Also, I've left some methods as placeholders (e.g., `capacity`, `iterator`) because they were not implemented in the original Java code. You would need to implement them according to your specific requirements.
