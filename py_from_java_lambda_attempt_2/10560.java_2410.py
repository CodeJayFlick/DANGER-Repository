Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import logging

class ConsoleTaskMonitor:
    def set_message(self, message):
        logging.info(message)
```

Note that this Python code does not exactly replicate the original Java code. The `setMessage` method in the Java class is overridden to print a log message with the given string using the `logging` module's `info` function.
