Here is the translation of the Java interface into a Python class:

```python
class FileBasedIcon:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_filename(self) -> str:
        """Get the name of the image which in most cases will be the associated data file path."""
        return ""
```

Note that I've used the `-> str` syntax to indicate that the method returns a string, and added docstrings for each method as per Python's convention.
