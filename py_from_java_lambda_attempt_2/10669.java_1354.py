Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python

                assert False, f"Value at key {key} should be {value}, but instead is {ht.get(key)}"
        except KeyError:
            assert False, f"No value found at key {key} but should have had value {value}"

    @staticmethod
    def test_contains(ht, keys):
        for i in range(len(keys)):
            if not ht.contains(str(keys[i])):
                assert False, f"hastable should contain key {keys[i]}, but it doesn't"

            if str(i) in keys:

        self.test(ht, "C", 300)
        self.test(ht, "D", 400)

        try:
            _ = ht.get("G")
            assert False, f"The value {_} was found at key G, but there should not have been a value there."
        except KeyError:

            assert False, f"size should be 3, but it is {ht.size()}"

        test_contains(ht, ["A", "C", "D"], "Remove")

        print("Test removeAll")
        ht.removeAll()
        if ht.size() != 0:
            assert False, f"size should be 0, but it is {ht.size()}"

        test_contains(ht, [], "RemoveAll")

        print("Test grow by adding 500 values")
        for i in range(500):

                    assert False, f"hashtable contains key {i}, but it shouldn't"
            else:

class ObjectIntHashtable:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def put(self, key, value):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def get(self, key):
        # implement your logic here
        raise KeyError("No value found at this key")

    def contains(self, key):
        return False  # implement your logic here

    def size(self):
        return 0  # implement your logic here

    def remove(self, key):
        pass  # implement your logic here

    def removeAll(self):
        pass  # implement your logic here
```

Note: This is a translation of the given Java code into Python. However, it does not include any actual implementation for methods like `put`, `get`, `contains`, `size`, `remove` and `removeAll`. You would need to add these implementations based on how you want your `ObjectIntHashtable` class to behave in Python.
