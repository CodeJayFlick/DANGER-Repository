Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import weakref

class KeyEnumeratorInternal:
    _cache = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()

    @classmethod
    def instance_for(cls, data):
        return DbgModelUtil.lazy_weak_cache(KeyEnumeratorInternal._cache, data, lambda: cls())

    PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS = {}

    @classmethod
    def try_preferred_interfaces(cls, supplier):
        return DbgModelUtil.try_preferred_interfaces(cls, KeyEnumeratorInternal.PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS, supplier)
```

Note that I did not translate the Java-specific parts like `Map`, `ImmutableMap`, and `REFIID` as they do not have direct equivalents in Python. Also, the code assumes there is a separate module or class named `DbgModelUtil` which contains utility functions for debugging models.

In this translation:

- The `CACHE` variable has been replaced with `_cache`, an instance of `weakref.WeakValueDictionary`.
- The `instanceFor` method now uses a lambda function to create the new object.
- The `PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS_BUILDER` and `PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS` have been simplified into a single dictionary assignment.
