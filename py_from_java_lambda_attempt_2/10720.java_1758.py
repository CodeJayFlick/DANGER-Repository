Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python equivalent:

```Python
from typing import List, Any

class FindPathsAlgorithm:
    def find_paths(self, g: dict, start: Any, end: Any, accumulator: list, monitor=None) -> None:
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass

    def set_status_listener(self, listener):
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java interfaces. Instead, we can define a base class with abstract methods (methods without implementation). The `find_paths` and `set_status_listener` are placeholders for the actual implementations which will be provided by subclasses.

The types used here (`List`, `Any`) are from the built-in Python type hints module.
