Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class JungLayout(VVisualVertex, EVisualEdge):
    def __init__(self, jung_layout: Layout[V, E]):
        super().__init__(jung_layout)

    def clone_jung_layout(self, new_graph: VisualGraph[V, E]) -> Layout[V, E]:
        return super().clone_jung_layout(new_graph).map(lambda x: JungLayout(x))

    def get_jung_layout(self) -> Layout[None, None]:
        return self.delegate
```
Note that I've used the following Python type hints:

* `VVisualVertex` and `EVisualEdge`: These are placeholder types for the vertex and edge types, respectively. In Java, these would be generic types (`<V>` and `<E>`) but in Python, we don't have explicit generics.
* `Layout[V, E]`: This is a type hint for the Jung layout object.

Also note that I've used the `map` function to create a new instance of `JungLayout` when cloning the Jung layout. In Java, this would be done using recursion (i.e., calling the constructor with the cloned Jung layout as an argument).
