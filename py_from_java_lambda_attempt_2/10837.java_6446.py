Here is the equivalent Python code:

```
class PathHighlightMode:
    ALL_CYCLES = "ALLCYCLE"
    CYCLE = "CYCLE"
    IN = "IN"
    IN_OUT = "INOUT"
    OFF = "OFF"
    OUT = "OUT"
    PATH = "PATH"
    SCOPED_FORWARD = "SCOPED_FORWARD"
    SCOPED_REVERSE = "SCOPED_REVERSE"

# Note: Enums in Python are typically implemented as classes with class-level attributes.
```

Note that I did not include the copyright notice and license information, as this is a translation of code from another language (Java) to Python.
