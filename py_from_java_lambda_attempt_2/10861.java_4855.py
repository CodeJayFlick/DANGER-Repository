class VertexShapeProvider:
    """An interface that can be implemented to provide vertex shapes to the UI.  These are used
       for rendering and mouse interaction.  Typically, these shapes are the same.   Clients that
       wish to allow for complicated shapes can use this interface to control mouse hit detection
       while providing simpler shape painting.

    def get_compact_shape(self) -> object:
        """Returns the compact shape that the user will see when full, detailed rendering is

Note that I did not translate the Java package declaration (`package ghidra.graph.viewer.vertex;`) as it is specific to the Java language and does not have an equivalent in Python. Additionally, I used the `pass` statement for the `get_compact_shape()` method since there was no implementation provided in the original code.
