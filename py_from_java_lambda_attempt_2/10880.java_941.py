Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```
# ###

class GraphLabelPosition:
    """
    Specification for the vertex label position relative to the vertex shape.
    """

    NORTH = 1
    NORTHEAST = 2
    EAST = 3
    SOUTHEAST = 4
    SOUTH = 5
    SOUTHWEST = 6
    WEST = 7
    NORTHWEST = 8
    CENTER = 9

# End of file.
```

Note that Python does not have an equivalent to Java's `enum` keyword. Instead, we define a class with named constants (in this case, the vertex label positions).
