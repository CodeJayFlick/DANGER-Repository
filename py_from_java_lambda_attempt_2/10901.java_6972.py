Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class TestGraphLayout:
    def __init__(self, jung_layout):
        self.jung_layout = jung_layout

    def clone_layout(self, new_graph):
        new_jung_layout = self.clone_jung_layout(new_graph)
        return TestGraphLayout(new_jung_layout)

    # Assuming you have a method to clone the Jung layout
    def clone_jung_layout(self, graph):
        pass  # Implement this method based on your requirements

# Example usage:
jung_layout = Layout()  # Replace with actual implementation of Layout class
test_graph_layout = TestGraphLayout(jung_layout)
new_graph = VisualGraph()  # Replace with actual implementation of VisualGraph class
cloned_test_graph_layout = test_graph_layout.clone_layout(new_graph)
```

Please note that the Python code does not have direct equivalent for Java's `package`, `import` statements, and some other constructs. The above translation is based on understanding the intent behind the given Java code.

Also, please replace `Layout()`, `VisualGraph()` with actual implementations of these classes in your Python program.
