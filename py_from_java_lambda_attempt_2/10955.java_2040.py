Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class NonExistentIMGFileInvalidLink:
    MESSAGE = "Unable to locate image file"

    def __init__(self, img):
        super().__init__(img, self.MESSAGE)
```
Note that I've removed the `package` declaration and the licensing information, as these are not relevant in Python. Additionally, I've used the `class` keyword to define a class, rather than using the `public` access modifier (which is not necessary in Python). The constructor (`__init__`) method has been translated from Java's syntax to Python's syntax.
