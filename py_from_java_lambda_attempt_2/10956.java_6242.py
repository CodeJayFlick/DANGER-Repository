Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import os
from ghidra_util import AssertException  # assuming this module exists in your project

class DirectoryHelpModuleLocation:
    def __init__(self, file):
        self.file_path = str(file.path)

    def is_help_input_source(self):
        return True

    def load_help_set(self):
        # help sets are generated from a directory module structure, thus one does not exist here
        return None

    def load_source_toc_file(self):
        toc_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "TOC_Source.xml")
        try:
            return GhidraTOCFile(toc_path)
        except Exception as e:
            raise AssertException(f"Unexpected error loading source TOC file!: {toc_path}", e)

class GhidraTOCFile:
    @staticmethod
    def create_ghidra_toc_file(path):
        # implement this method to load the TOC file
        pass

# usage example
file = "path/to/file"
location = DirectoryHelpModuleLocation(file)
print(location.is_help_input_source())  # True
print(location.load_help_set())  # None
try:
    toc_file = location.load_source_toc_file()
except AssertException as e:
    print(e)  # Unexpected error loading source TOC file!: path/to/TOC_Source.xml
```
Note that I made the following assumptions:

* The `GhidraUtil` module exists in your project and contains an `AssertException` class.
* You need to implement the `create_ghidra_toc_file` method in the `GhidraTOCFile` class.

Also, keep in mind that this is a translation of Java code to Python, so some differences are expected. For example:

* In Java, you can use static imports (e.g., `import java.io.File;`) whereas in Python, you need to import modules explicitly.
* In Java, you have separate classes for exceptions (`Exception`), whereas in Python, you can raise built-in exceptions like `ValueError`.
* In Java, you have a more verbose syntax for method overriding and exception handling.
