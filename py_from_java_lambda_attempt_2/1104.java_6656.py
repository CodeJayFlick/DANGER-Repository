Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class WrapIComparableConcept:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    class ByReference:
        pass

    def compare_objects(self, context_object, other_object, comparison_result):
        # Assuming _invoke_hr and VTIndices are defined elsewhere in your program.
        return self._invoke_hr(WTIndices.COMPARE_OBJECTS, self.get_pointer(), context_object, other_object, comparison_result)

class UnknownWithUtils:
    pass

# Define the constants
WTIndices = {'COMPARE_OBJECTS': 0}
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java's `package`, `import` statements or `extends`. The equivalent of a class extending another in Java is achieved by using inheritance in Python.
