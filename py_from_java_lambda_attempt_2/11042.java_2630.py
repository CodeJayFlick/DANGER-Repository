Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class CheckoutInfo:
    def __init__(self, file):
        self.file = file
        try:
            self.status = file.get_checkout_status()
        except Exception as e:
            raise IOException(f"Error getting checkout status: {e}")

    @property
    def file(self):
        return self.file

    @file.setter
    def file(self, value):
        self.file = value

    @property
    def status(self):
        return self.status

    @status.setter
    def status(self, value):
        self.status = value
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the `DomainFile` and `ItemCheckoutStatus` classes since they are not provided in the original Java code. In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's `throws IOException`, so instead, I wrapped the call to `file.get_checkout_status()` in a try-except block to catch any exceptions that might be raised.

Also, note that Python does not require explicit getters and setters like Java does. The `@property` decorator is used to create read-only properties (in this case), but you can also use it to create writeable properties by adding a setter method as shown above.
