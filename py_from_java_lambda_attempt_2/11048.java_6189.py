Here's the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class Cuttable:
    def set_is_cut(self, b: bool):
        pass  # Implement this method as needed

    def is_cut(self) -> bool:
        return False  # Default value for cut status
```

Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's `public` keyword. The class and its methods are accessible by default when defined at the top level or within another module. If you want to restrict access to certain parts of your code, consider using private variables (prefixed with `_`) or encapsulating them in separate classes.

The Python version also doesn't have a direct equivalent for Java's `boolean` type; instead, we use the built-in boolean data type (`bool`).
