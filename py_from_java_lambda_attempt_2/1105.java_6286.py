Here is a translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class WrapIDataModelConcept:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __init__(self, pv_instance):
        super().__init__()

    def InitializeObject(self, model_object, matching_type_signature, wildcard_matches):
        # This method seems to be calling a native function.
        # In Python, you would typically use the `subprocess` module or some other way
        # of interacting with your operating system's process management facilities,
        # rather than trying to simulate this behavior directly in Python code.

    def GetName(self, model_name):
        pass

class ByReference(WrapIDataModelConcept):
    pass


# This is equivalent to the Java interface IDataModelConcept.
class IDataModelConcept:
    @abstractmethod
    def InitializeObject(self, model_object, matching_type_signature, wildcard_matches):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def GetName(self, model_name):
        pass
```

Please note that this translation does not include any error handling or exception management.
