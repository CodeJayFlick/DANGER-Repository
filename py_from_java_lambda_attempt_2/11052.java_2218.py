class DataTreeFlavorHandler:
    def handle(self, tool: 'PluginTool', data_tree: 'DataTree', destination_node: 'GTreeNode',
               transfer_data: object, drop_action: int):
        pass

```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface concept. Instead, we define a class with abstract methods in it to achieve similar functionality.
