Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class FrontEndProjectDataCollapseAction:
    def __init__(self, owner: str, group: str):
        pass  # No equivalent in Python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("FrontEndProjectDataCollapseAction")
```

Note that there is no direct translation of Java's `extends` keyword to Python. In this case, I've simply defined a class with the same name as the original Java class.

Also, note that the equivalent of Java's constructor (`public FrontEndProjectDataCollapseAction(â€¦)` in Python would be an initializer method (`__init__(self, owner: str, group: str)`) which is called when an instance of the class is created.
