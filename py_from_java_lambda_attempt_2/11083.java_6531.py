Here is the translation of the Java interface `FrontEndService` into a Python class:

```python
class FrontEndService:
    def add_project_listener(self, listener):
        """Adds the specified listener to the front-end tool."""
        pass  # TO DO: implement this method

    def remove_project_listener(self, listener):
        """Removes the specified listener from the front-end tool."""
        pass  # TO DO: implement this method
```

Note that I've used Python's convention for naming methods (e.g., `add_project_listener` instead of `addProjectListener`) and omitted any Java-specific syntax. The class is defined using the standard Python class definition, with two instance methods (`__init__`, not shown here) to implement the interface.

The actual implementation of these methods would depend on your specific use case; in this example, I've left them as placeholder comments for you to fill in.
