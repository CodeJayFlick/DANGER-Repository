Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python code:

```Python
class CheckoutsDialog:
    def __init__(self, tool, user, domain_file, checkouts):
        self.panel = None  # Initialize panel as None
        super().__init__("View Checkouts for " + str(domain_file), False)
        help_location = HelpLocation(GenericHelpTopics.REPOSITORY, "View_Check_Outs")
        set_help_location(help_location)  # Set the help location

    def create_actions(self):
        self.panel.create_actions(self)

    def dismiss_callback(self):
        close()
        if self.panel is not None:
            self.panel.dispose()

    def project_closed(self, project):
        self.dismiss_callback()

    def project_opened(self, project):
        pass  # Don't care

class CheckoutsActionContext:
    def __init__(self, selected_rows):
        self.selected_rows = selected_rows
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java classes like `DomainFile`, `ItemCheckoutStatus`, and others. These are likely custom data structures or interfaces in the original codebase. In this translation, I've omitted these details to focus on translating the logic of the dialog class.

Also note that Python's syntax is different from Java's. For example:

* The constructor (`__init__`) has a slightly different signature.
* There is no direct equivalent for `super()` in Python; instead, you can use the built-in function with parentheses.
* Method overriding uses the same syntax as regular method definition (i.e., without the `@Override` annotation).
* Classes are defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name and colon.
