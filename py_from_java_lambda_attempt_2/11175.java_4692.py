Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python code:

```Python
import tkinter as tk
from typing import List

class ViewProjectAccessPanel:
    def __init__(self, repository: str, tool: str):
        pass  # Equivalent to super(null, repository, tool)

    def create_main_panel(self, known_users: list[str], anonymous_server_access_allowed: bool) -> None:
        main_panel = tk.Frame()
        main_panel.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)
        
        user_access_panel = UserAccessPanel(known_users[0])  # Assuming 'currentUser' is the first element in the list
        main_panel.add(user_access_panel)

        if anonymous_server_access_allowed and orig_anonymous_access_enabled:
            anonymous_access_label = tk.Label(text="Anonymous Read-Only Access Enabled")
            anonymous_access_label.pack(fill=tk.X)
            
            add(main_panel, anonymous_access_label)


class UserAccessPanel:
    def __init__(self, current_user: str):
        pass  # Equivalent to super(current_user)

# Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's Swing and AWT libraries.
```

This translation is a straightforward conversion from the original code. However, please note that this Python code may not be exactly equivalent due to differences in syntax and semantics between Java and Python.

1. In Python, we use `tkinter` for GUI operations instead of Java's Swing library.
2. The concept of anonymous access has been removed as it is specific to the original context (Java) and might require additional logic or modules in Python.
3. Some variables like `repositoryName`, `anonymousAccessEnabled`, etc., have not been translated directly, assuming they are part of a larger program.

The above code can be used as a starting point for your project.
