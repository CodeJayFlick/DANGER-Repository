Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import ctypes

class WrapIDataModelScriptDebugBreakpointEnumerator:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __init__(self, pv_instance):
        self.pv_instance = pv_instance

    def Reset(self):
        # Assuming _invokeHR and VTIndices are defined elsewhere in the codebase.
        return _invokeHR(VTIndices.RESET, self.pv_instance)

    def GetNext(self, breakpoint_by_reference):
        return _invokeHR(VTIndices.GET_NEXT, self.pv_instance, breakpoint_by_reference)


class ByReference(WrapIDataModelScriptDebugBreakpointEnumerator):
    pass
```

Please note that the `_invokeHR` and `VTIndices` are not defined in this code. They should be replaced with their actual Python equivalents or definitions.

Also, please note that JNA (Java Native Access) is a Java library for mapping native libraries into Java classes. There isn't an exact equivalent of it in Python. You might need to use other libraries like `ctypes` or `pyjnius` depending on your requirements.
