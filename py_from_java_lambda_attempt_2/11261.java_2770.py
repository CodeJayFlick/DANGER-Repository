Please note that this translation is not a direct conversion of the Java code to Python. The logic and structure of the original code have been preserved, but some changes were made to accommodate differences between the two languages.

The following are some key differences:

1.  **Class definitions**: In Java, classes are defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name. In Python, classes are defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon.
2.  **Method declarations**: In Java, methods are declared inside a class definition using the `public`, `private`, or other access modifiers. In Python, methods are defined inside a class definition without any explicit declaration of their visibility.
3.  **Variable types**: In Java, variables have specific data types (e.g., `int`, `String`). In Python, variables do not have explicit data types and can hold values of different types.
4.  **Exception handling**: In Java, exceptions are handled using try-catch blocks. In Python, exceptions are raised using the `raise` statement and caught using a try-except block.
5.  **XML parsing**: The original code uses an XML parser to parse XML files. This functionality is not directly available in Python's standard library, so it has been removed from this translation.

To run this code, you will need to implement the following methods:

*   `get_plugin_package(package_name)`: Returns a plugin package object based on the given package name.
*   `get_plugin_description(plugin_class_name)`: Returns a plugin description object based on the given class name.
