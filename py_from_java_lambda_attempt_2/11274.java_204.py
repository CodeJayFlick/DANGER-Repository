Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class ProjectDataService:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_project_data(self) -> dict:
        # You can return any data structure you want here.
        # For example, if your project data is stored in JSON format,
        # you could load it from a file and return the dictionary
        # representation of that data. If not, just return an empty dictionary for now.
        return {}
```

Note: Python does not have direct equivalent to Java's interface concept. However, we can achieve similar functionality using abstract base classes (ABCs) or interfaces implemented by other classes.

In this example, `ProjectDataService` is a class that defines the methods you would expect from an interface in Java. The `get_project_data` method returns some data structure which could be JSON file loaded into dictionary representation of project data.
