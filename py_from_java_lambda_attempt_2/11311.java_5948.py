Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class GTaskListModel(list):
    def fire_contents_changed(self, start, end):
        pass  # implement this method as needed

    def fire_interval_added(self, start, end):
        pass  # implement this method as needed

    def fire_interval_removed(self, start, end):
        pass  # implement this method as needed
```
Note that I've used the `list` class in Python to create a custom list-like object. The methods are similar to those in Java, but since Python is dynamically typed and doesn't have explicit type parameters like Java does with generics (`<T>`), we don't need to specify the type parameter here.

Also note that the implementation of these methods (e.g., `fire_contents_changed`) will depend on your specific use case and requirements.
