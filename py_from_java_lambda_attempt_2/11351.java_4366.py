Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class ProgramMappedLoadImage:
    def __init__(self, pmm):
        self.pmm = pmm

    def load_fill(self, bytes, size, addr, offset, generate_initialized_mask=False):
        return self.pmm.read(bytes, size, addr, offset, generate_initialized_mask)

    def write_back(self, bytes, size, addr, offset):
        self.pmm.write(bytes, size, addr, offset)

    def dispose(self):
        self.pmm.dispose()
```
Note that I've removed the Java-specific comments and licensing information, as well as any non-Python code (e.g. imports). The Python code is a direct translation of the original Java code, with some minor adjustments to fit the syntax and semantics of the Python language.

Here's a brief explanation of each method:

* `__init__`: Initializes an instance of the class by setting its internal state (`pmm`) based on the input argument.
* `load_fill`: Reads data from memory using the underlying `ProgramMappedMemory` object, with optional generation of an initialized mask. The return value is a byte array containing the loaded data.
* `write_back`: Writes data to memory using the underlying `ProgramMappedMemory` object.
* `dispose`: Releases any resources held by the class instance.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
