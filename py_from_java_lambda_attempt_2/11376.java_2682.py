Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
class EndInstructionValueSolver:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def solve(self, iv: 'EndInstructionValue', goal: int, vals: dict, res: dict,
              cur: object, hints: set, description: str) -> None:
        raise AssertionError("INTERNAL: Should never be asked to solve for " + AssemblyTreeResolver.INST_NEXT)

    def get_value(self, iv: 'EndInstructionValue', vals: dict, res: dict, cur: object) -> int:
        inst_next = vals.get(AssemblyTreeResolver.INST_NEXT)
        if inst_next is None:
            raise NeedsBackfillException(AssemblyTreeResolver.INST_NEXT)
        return inst_next

    def get_instruction_length(self, iv: 'EndInstructionValue', res: dict) -> int:
        return 0

    def value_for_resolution(self, exp: 'EndInstructionValue', rc: object) -> None:
        raise UnsupportedOperationException("The solver should never ask for this value given a resolved constructor.")
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java's `package`, `import` statements or the concept of classes being part of packages. Also, Python uses indentation instead of curly braces to define code blocks.

Additionally, I replaced some parts with equivalent Python constructs:

- The `Map<java.lang.String, java.lang.Long>` in Java is represented as a dictionary (`dict`) in Python.
- The `MaskedLong` class from the original Java code does not have an exact equivalent in Python. In this translation, it was assumed that you would want to return an integer value instead of using some kind of masked long.

This Python version should be functionally similar to the provided Java code, but with different syntax and structure.
