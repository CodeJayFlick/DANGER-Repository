Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class MinusExpressionSolver:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def compute(self, val: int) -> int:
        return -val


# Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's generics.
# The type of the value is explicitly specified as an integer (int).
```

This code defines a class `MinusExpressionSolver` with two methods. The constructor (`__init__`) initializes the object and does nothing else. The method `compute` takes an integer, negates it using Python's unary minus operator `-`, and returns the result.
