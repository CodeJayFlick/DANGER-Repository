Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
class StartInstructionValueSolver:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def solve(self, iv: 'StartInstructionValue', goal: int, vals: dict, res: dict, cur: any, hints: set, description: str) -> tuple:
        raise AssertionError("INTERNAL: Should never be asked to solve for " + AssemblyTreeResolver.INST_START)

    def get_value(self, iv: 'StartInstructionValue', vals: dict, res: dict, cur: any) -> int:
        return vals.get(AssemblyTreeResolver.INST_START)

    def get_instruction_length(self, exp: 'StartInstructionValue', res: dict) -> int:
        return 0

    def value_for_resolution(self, exp: 'StartInstructionValue', rc: any) -> tuple:
        raise UnsupportedOperationException("The solver should never ask for this value given a resolved constructor.")
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `Map`, `Set` and other data structures. Instead, you can use built-in dictionaries (`dict`) and sets (`set`). Also, the types are specified using type hints which is optional in Python but recommended for better code readability and maintainability.

Also, please note that this translation assumes that all methods return something (either a value or an exception), whereas some of them might not have any effect in Java.
