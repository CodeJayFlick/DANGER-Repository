Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AssemblyProduction:
    def __init__(self, lhs: 'AssemblyNonTerminal', rhs: 'AssemblySentential[AssemblyNonTerminal]'):
        pass  # super(lhs, rhs) in Python


# Note that we don't have direct equivalents for Java's package and import statements.
```

Here are some key differences between the two languages:

1. Inheritance: The equivalent of `extends AbstractAssemblyProduction<AssemblyNonTerminal>` is simply specifying the class as a parameter to the constructor.

2. Method definition: Python uses indentation instead of curly braces to define methods, so we don't need any method definitions here.

3. Type declarations: Java requires explicit type declarations for variables and parameters. In Python, you can omit these if you're using dynamic typing (which is default in Python).

4. Package declaration: Python doesn't have a direct equivalent to Java's package statement. You could use docstrings or comments to document the module structure.

5. Import statements: Python uses `import` for importing modules and classes from other files, whereas Java uses `import`.
