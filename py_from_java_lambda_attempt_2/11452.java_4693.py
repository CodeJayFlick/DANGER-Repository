Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class SubtableEntryVisitor:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def visit(self, pattern: 'DisjointPattern', cons: 'Constructor') -> int:
        """Callback to visit a constructor"""
        # TO DO: implement your logic here
        return 0


# Note that in Python, we don't have an equivalent of Java's "interface" concept.
# Instead, you can define a class with abstract methods (methods without implementation).
```

In this translation:

- The `SubtableEntryVisitor` is defined as a Python class. It does not inherit from any other class or interface.

- The `visit` method is an instance method of the `SubtableEntryVisitor`. This method takes two parameters: `pattern` and `cons`, both of which are expected to be instances of classes named `'DisjointPattern'` and `'Constructor'`, respectively. It returns an integer value, as specified in the Java code.

- The comment block at the top is not translated into Python because it's a license notice that doesn't have any direct equivalent in Python.
