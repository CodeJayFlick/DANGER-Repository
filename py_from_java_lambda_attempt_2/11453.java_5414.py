Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class VisitorResults:
    CONTINUE = 0
    FINISHED = 1
    TERMINATE = 2

    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

This Python class has three constants, `CONTINUE`, `FINISHED` and `TERMINATE`, which are equivalent to the Java interface's static final integer fields. The constructor is empty as there is no need for any initialization in this case.
