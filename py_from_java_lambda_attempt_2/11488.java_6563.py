Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MultExpression:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_value(self, walker):
        try:
            left_val = self.get_left().get_value(walker)
            right_val = self.get_right().get_value(walker)
            return left_val * right_val
        except Exception as e:
            raise MemoryAccessException(str(e))

    def __str__(self):
        return f"({self.get_left()} * {self.get_right()})"

class BinaryExpression:
    pass

class PatternExpression:
    def get_value(self, walker):
        # implement this method according to your needs
        pass

    def get_left(self):
        # implement this method according to your needs
        pass

    def get_right(self):
        # implement this method according to your needs
        pass
```

Please note that the Python code above is a direct translation of Java into equivalent Python. The `PatternExpression` class and its methods (`get_value`, `get_left`, `get_right`) are not implemented in the given Java code, so I left them as they were in the original Java code for you to implement according to your needs.

Also note that there is no direct equivalent of Java's "throws" keyword in Python. Instead, exceptions can be raised using the `raise` statement.
