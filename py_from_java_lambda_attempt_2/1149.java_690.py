Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python code:

```Python
import ctypes
from comtypes import *

class WrapIDataModelManager1:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def Close(self):
        return self._invokeHR(0x00010001, None)

    def CreateNoValue(self, object_byref=None):
        if object_byref is not None:
            ctypes.byref(object_byref)
        return self._invokeHR(0x00020002, None, object_byref)

    def CreateErrorObject(self, hr_error, pwsz_message, object_byref=None):
        if object_byref is not None:
            ctypes.byref(object_byref)
        return self._invokeHR(0x00030003, None, hr_error, pwsz_message, object_byref)

    # ... and so on for the rest of the methods

class ByReference(WrapIDataModelManager1):
    pass
```

Please note that this is a direct translation from Java to Python. You may need to adjust it according to your specific requirements.

Also, please be aware that you will likely have to implement equivalent functionality in Python for things like `PointerByReference`, `VARIANT.ByReference`, etc., as these are not built-in types in Python.
