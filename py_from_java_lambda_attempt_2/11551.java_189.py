Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class VarnodeData:
    def __init__(self):
        self.space = None  # equivalent to AddressSpace in Java
        self.offset = 0  # equivalent to long offset in Java
        self.size = 0  # equivalent to int size in Java

import ghidra.program.model.address.AddressSpace  # assuming this is a Python module or class

# Note: In Python, we don't need explicit getters and setters like in Java.
```
Note that I didn't translate the `package` declaration or the comments from the original code, as they are not part of the actual programming logic.
