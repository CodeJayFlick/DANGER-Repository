Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from enum import Enum

class VTIndices2(Enum):
    ASSIGN_TO = 0


class IDebugHostEvaluator2:
    IID_IDEBUG_HOST_EVALUATOR2 = "A117A435-1FB4-4092-A2AB-929576C1E87"

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def AssignTo(self, assignment_reference: object, assignment_value: object,
                 assignment_result_by_ref: object, assignment_metadata_by_ref: object) -> int:
        # This is equivalent to HRESULT in Java
        return 0


# Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent of the 'Pointer' and 'PointerByReference'
# classes from Java. You would need to use other data structures or libraries (like ctypes)
```

Please note that this translation assumes you are using Python 3.x, as it uses type hints for function parameters which is available in Python 3.x but not in Python 2.x.
