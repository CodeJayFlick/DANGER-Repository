Here is a translation of the Java interface `IDebugHostMemory1` into equivalent Python code:

```Python
class IDebugHostMemory1:
    IID_IDEBUG_HOST_MEMORY = "212149C9-9183-4a3e-B00E-4FD1DC95339B"

    class VTIndices1:
        READ_BYTES, WRITE_BYTES, READ_POINTERS, WRITE_POINTERS, GET_DISPLAY_STRING_FOR_LOCATION = range(5)

        @classmethod
        def get_index(cls):
            return cls.READ_POINTERS

    def read_bytes(self, context: object, location: str, buffer: bytes, size: int) -> tuple:
        # implement the logic for reading bytes from memory
        pass

    def write_bytes(self, context: object, location: str, buffer: bytes, size: int) -> tuple:
        # implement the logic for writing bytes to memory
        pass

    def read_pointers(self, context: object, location: str, count: int) -> list:
        # implement the logic for reading pointers from memory
        return []

    def write_pointers(self, context: object, location: str, count: int) -> tuple:
        # implement the logic for writing pointers to memory
        pass

    def get_display_string_for_location(self, context: object, location: str, verbose: bool) -> str:
        # implement the logic for getting a display string for a given location
        return ""
```

Please note that this is just an equivalent translation and does not include any actual implementation of the methods.
