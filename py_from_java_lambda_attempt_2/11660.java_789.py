Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class FixedHandle:
    def __init__(self):
        self.space = None
        self.size = 0
        self.offset_space = None
        self.offset_offset = 0
        self.offset_size = 0
        self.temp_space = None
        self.temp_offset = 0

# No imports needed in Python, just define the class!
```
Note that I didn't translate any of the Java-specific concepts like `public` access modifiers or `AddrSpace` classes to their equivalent Python constructs. The above code is a direct translation of the Java class definition into Python syntax.
