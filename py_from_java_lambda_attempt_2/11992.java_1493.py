Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class MemoryMapDBAdapterV1:
    VERSION = 1
    
    def __init__(self, handle, mem_map):
        # This part might need some adjustments based on how you're using DBHandle and MemoryMap in your actual program.
        pass
```

Note that the Java code has been translated to Python as follows:

- The `package` declaration is not necessary or equivalent in Python. 
- The comments are preserved, but they don't have any direct equivalent in Python (although docstrings can be used for similar purposes).
- The class definition and its attributes (`VERSION`) are straightforwardly converted.
- The constructor (`__init__`) method has been translated from Java to Python syntax.

Please note that this is a very basic translation. Depending on how you're using `DBHandle` and `MemoryMap`, the actual implementation might be more complex in Python as well.
