Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python code:

```Python
class WrapIDebugHostTypeSignature:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __init__(self, pv_instance):
        super().__init__()

    def get_hash_code(self) -> int:
        # Implement _invokeHR and VTIndices here.
        return 0

    def is_match(self, type: bytes, is_match: bool, wildcard_matches: 'PointerByReference') -> int:
        # Implement _invokeHR and PointerByReference here.
        return 0

    def compare_against(self, type_signature: bytes) -> int:
        # Implement _invokeHR here.
        return 0


class ByReference(WrapIDebugHostTypeSignature):
    pass
```

Please note that this translation is not a direct conversion from Java to Python. The original code uses JNA (Java Native Access), which allows you to call native libraries from Java, but there's no equivalent in Python. Therefore, the `_invokeHR` method and `VTIndices` class are placeholders for actual implementation.

Also, note that this translation does not include any error handling or exception management as it is a direct conversion of code structure rather than functionality.
