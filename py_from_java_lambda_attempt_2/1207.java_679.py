Here is the translation of the Java interface `IKeyStore` into a Python class:

```python
import ctypes

class IUnknownEx:
    pass  # This is an abstract base class in Java; we don't need it here.

class VTableIndex(int):
    GET_KEY = 3
    SET_KEY = 4
    GET_KEY_VALUE = 5
    SET_KEY_VALUE = 6
    CLEAR_KEYS = 7

class IKeyStore:
    IID_IKEY_STORE = "0FC7557D-401D-4fca-9365-DA1E9850697C"

    def __init__(self):
        pass  # This is the constructor in Java; we don't need it here.

    def GetKey(self, key: str, object_ptr: ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_void_p), metadata_ptr: ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_void_p)) -> int:
        return 0  # HRESULT

    def SetKey(self, key: str, object: ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_void_p), metadata: ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_void_p)) -> int:
        return 0  # HRESULT

    def GetKeyValue(self, key: str, object_ptr: ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_void_p), metadata_ptr: ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_void_p)) -> int:
        return 0  # HRESULT

    def SetKeyValue(self, key: str, object: ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_void_p)) -> int:
        return 0  # HRESULT

    def ClearKeys(self) -> int:
        return 0  # HRESULT
```

Note that I've used the `ctypes` module to represent pointers and integers in Python. This is because Java's `PointerByReference` class doesn't have a direct equivalent in Python, so we need to use a library like `ctypes` or `cffi` to create similar functionality.

Also note that this translation assumes that you want to keep the same method signatures as the original Java interface. If you want to change them (e.g., by adding arguments or modifying return types), you'll need to do so manually in Python.
