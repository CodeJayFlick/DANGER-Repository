Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from ctypes import POINTER, HRESULT, GUID

class VTableIndex:
    OVERRIDE_CONTEXT_OBJECT = 0

    def __init__(self):
        self.start = type(self).OVERRIDE_CONTEXT_OBJECT + 1

    @property
    def getIndex(self):
        return self.ordinal() + self.start


class IModelKeyReference2(IModelKeyReference):
    IID_IMODEL_REFERENCE2 = GUID("80E2F7C5-7159-4e92-887E-7E0347E88406")

    VTIndices2 = VTableIndex()

    def OverrideContextObject(self, new_context_object: POINTER) -> HRESULT:
        pass


class IModelKeyReference:
    pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `interface`, `enum`, and `HRESULT`. Instead, we use classes to define the interface-like behavior of `IModelKeyReference2` and its methods. The equivalent of an enum is implemented as a class with static attributes representing the possible values.

The `OverrideContextObject` method in Python does not have any direct equivalent for Java's `HRESULT`, but it can be replaced by returning some kind of error code or exception, depending on how you want to handle errors in your program.
