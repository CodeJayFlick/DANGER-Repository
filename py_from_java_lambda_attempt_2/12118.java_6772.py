Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import io

class DBKeyAdapter:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_keys(self, start: int, end: int) -> iter:
        """
        Get an iterator over the keys in the given range.
        
        :param start: Start of range
        :param end: End of range (inclusive)
        :return: Iterator over keys
        :raises: IOException if there was a problem accessing the database
        """
        # TO DO: implement this method to return an iterator over keys
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")
```
Note that I've kept the `get_keys` method as is, but marked it with `NotImplementedError`, since we don't have equivalent concepts like interfaces or abstract methods in Python. In a real-world implementation, you would need to implement this method and return an iterator over keys.

Also, I didn't translate the Java-specific types (e.g., `Address`) into their Python equivalents, as they seem specific to your project's requirements.
