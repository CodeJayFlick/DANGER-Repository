Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
class AddressOverflowException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message="Displacement would result in an illegal address value."):
        super().__init__(message)

def main():
    try:
        # This will raise an exception if you're trying to access memory outside your program's bounds.
        pass  # Add code here that might cause the AddressOverflowException
    except AddressOverflowException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `UsrException` class. Instead, we can use Python's built-in exception handling mechanism and define our own custom exception using the `class` keyword.
