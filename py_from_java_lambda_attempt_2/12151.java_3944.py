Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from collections import abc

class AddressRangeIterator(abc.Iterable):
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    # Implementing abstract methods from Iterable interface
    def __iter__(self):
        return self
    
    def __next__(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")
    
    def __aiter__(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

# Note: The above code does not implement the full functionality of Java's AddressRangeIterator.
```

In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's interface. Instead, we use abstract base classes (ABCs) from the `collections` module. We define an ABC `AddressRangeIterator` that inherits from `abc.Iterable`. This class provides default implementations for the methods required by the `Iterable` protocol.

The `__init__`, `__iter__`, and `__next__` methods are implemented as per Python's iterator protocol, but they do not provide any actual functionality. The `__aiter__` method is also left unimplemented because asynchronous iteration (used in coroutines) is not relevant to this example.

This code does not translate the Java comments or imports directly into equivalent Python constructs.
