Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import ctypes
from comtypes import GUID, HRESULT, IUnknown, ULONGLONG

class WrapIModelIterator(IUnknown):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def Reset(self) -> HRESULT:
        # Implement your logic here. For example,
        return 0x00000000L  # S_OK

    def GetNext(self, object: ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_void_p), dimensions: ULONGLONG, 
                 indexers: ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_void_p), metadata: ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_void_p)) -> HRESULT:
        # Implement your logic here. For example,
        return 0x00000000L  # S_OK

class ByReference(WrapIModelIterator):
    pass
```

Note that this translation is not a direct equivalent of the Java code, but rather an approximation in Python. The original Java code uses JNA (Java Native Access) to interact with native libraries and Windows APIs, which does not have a direct equivalent in Python.
