Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class WrapIRawEnumerator:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __init__(self, pv_instance):
        super().__init__()

    def Reset(self):
        # assume _invokeHR and VTIndices are defined elsewhere in your program
        return self._invoke_HR(WT_Indices.RESET)

    def GetNext(self, name, kind, value):
        # assume _invokeHR is defined elsewhere in your program
        return self._invoke_HR(VT_Indices.GET_NEXT, name, kind, value)


class ByReference:
    pass

# You would need to define these functions and classes somewhere else in your Python code.
WT_Indices = {'RESET': 0}
VT_Indices = {'GET_NEXT': 1}

def _invoke_HR(index, *args):
    # implement the logic for invoking HR here
    return None


class PointerByReference:
    pass

class BSTRByReference:
    pass

class ULONGByReference:
    pass

class HRESULT:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java's `Structure`, `Pointer`, and other JNA classes. The above code is a simplified translation of the provided Java code into equivalent Python, but it may require additional work or third-party libraries (like ctypes) for more complex operations involving pointers and structures.
