Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This is a comment in Python - anything after "#" will be ignored by the interpreter.

import ghidra_util_classfinder  # Assuming this module exists in your project


class BuiltInDataTypeClassExclusionFilter:
    """An exclusion filter to use when searching for classes that implement `BuiltInDataType`"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__([BadDataType, MissingBuiltInDataType])  # This is equivalent to the Java constructor
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents of Java's packages and import statements. The above code assumes you already have a module named `ghidra_util_classfinder` in your project.

Also, Python doesn't support multiple inheritance (like Java), so if you need more than one base class for this class, you would need to use composition or create an abstract base class with the necessary methods and then inherit from that.
