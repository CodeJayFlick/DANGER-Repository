Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import ctypes.util

class WrapIUnknownEx:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __init__(self, pv_instance: bytes):
        super().__init__(pv_instance)

class ByReference(Structure):
    _fields_ = []

WrapIUnknownEx.ByReference = ByReference
```
Note that I did not include any imports for `com.sun.jna` or other Java-specific libraries, as they are not relevant to Python. Additionally, the `Pointer` class is replaced with a simple `bytes` type in Python.

Also, please note that this translation assumes that you want to keep the same structure and functionality of the original code, but it may not be exactly equivalent due to differences between Java and Python.
