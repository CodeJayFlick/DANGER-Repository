Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class DataTypeDependencyException(Exception):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def __init__(self, message):
        super().__init__(message)

    def __init__(self, cause):
        super().__init__(cause)

    def __init__(self, message, cause):
        super().__init__(message, cause)
```
Note that in Python, we don't need to specify the `public` access modifier as it is not applicable. Also, the equivalent of Java's `extends Exception` is simply inheriting from the built-in `Exception` class in Python.

Also, note that in Python, you can use a single-line docstring (the triple quotes) for documentation purposes, but I have kept the original format to maintain consistency with the Java code.
