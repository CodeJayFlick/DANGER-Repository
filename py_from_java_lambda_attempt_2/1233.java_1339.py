Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DbgModel2TargetProxy:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_delegate(self) -> 'DelegateDbgModel2TargetObject':
        # This method should return an instance of DelegateDbgModel2TargetObject.
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")
```

Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we define classes and use the concept of abstract methods (methods without implementation) to achieve similar functionality.

The `@Override` annotation is also specific to Java and has no direct equivalent in Python.
