Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DbgModel2TargetSystemMarkerImpl:
    def __init__(self, obj):
        super().__init__(obj.model, obj, "_system", "SystemMarker")

    def request_attributes(self, refresh=False) -> Completable[None]:
        nmap = {}
        return self.add_model_object_attributes(nmap)


class Completable(Tuple):
    pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's CompletableFuture. I've used a simple class `Completable` to represent the same concept in Python, which is essentially just a tuple.

Also, this translation assumes you are using Python 3.x and do not support some features specific to certain versions or platforms (like async/await).
