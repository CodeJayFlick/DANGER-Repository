Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import tkinter as tk
from PIL import ImageTk

class Playable:
    def get_image_icon(self):
        # Note: In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's ImageIcon class.
        # We can use an image file or create an image object using Pillow (PIL).
        pass
    
    def clicked(self, event):
        # Note: In Python, the equivalent of Java's MouseEvent is not built-in,
        # but you can simulate it by creating a custom Event class.
        pass
```
Note that I've used `tkinter` for GUI-related functionality and `Pillow (PIL)` to work with images. However, please note that this translation is not exact, as Python has different syntax and libraries than Java. The above code is just an approximation of the original Java interface in Python.
