Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class Pointer16DataType:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__init__(None)

    def __init__(self, dt=None):
        super().__init__(dt, 2)
```

Note that in this translation, I have not included any licensing information or class registration code as these are specific to Java and do not directly translate into Python.
