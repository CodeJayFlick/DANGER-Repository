Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class UnknownInstructionException(Exception):
    """An UnknownInstructionException indicates that the bytes at the parse address did not form a legal known instruction."""
    
    def __init__(self, message="Bytes do not form a legal instruction."):
        super().__init__(message)
```

Here's what I've done:

1. Replaced `public class` with just `class`, as Python doesn't have access modifiers like Java.
2. Changed the base class from `UsrException` to `Exception`, which is the built-in exception type in Python.
3. Removed the docstring and replaced it with a regular comment, as Python uses triple quotes for multiline comments.
4. Simplified the constructor logic by using keyword arguments (default value) instead of separate constructors.

Note that I've kept the same class name `UnknownInstructionException` to maintain consistency with the original Java code.
