Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class InVmModelForDbgmodelScenarioStackTest:
    def model_host(self):
        return InVmDbgmodelModelHost()

    def post_launch(self, process):
        pass

    def validate_frame_pc(self, index, pc):
        pass


class InVmDbgmodelModelHost:
    pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `@Override` annotation. Also, in Python, we don't need to specify the type of variables as it is dynamically typed language.
