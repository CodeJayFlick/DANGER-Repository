Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class Bookmark:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def get_id(self):
        # Implement this method with your own logic for getting bookmark id.
        return None  # Replace None with actual value.

    def get_address(self):
        # Implement this method with your own logic for getting address of the bookmark.
        return None  # Replace None with actual value.

    def get_type(self):
        # Implement this method with your own logic for getting type of the bookmark.
        return None  # Replace None with actual value.

    def get_type_string(self):
        # Implement this method with your own logic for converting bookmark type to string.
        return str(None)  # Replace None with actual value.

    def get_category(self):
        # Implement this method with your own logic for getting category of the bookmark.
        return None  # Replace None with actual value.

    def get_comment(self):
        # Implement this method with your own logic for getting comment of the bookmark.
        return None  # Replace None with actual value.

    def set(self, category: str, comment: str) -> None:
        self.category = category
        self.comment = comment

# Example usage:

bookmark = Bookmark()
print(bookmark.get_id())  # This will print None as we haven't implemented the method.
```

Note that this is a direct translation of Java code into Python. However, you might need to adjust it according to your specific requirements and needs in Python.
