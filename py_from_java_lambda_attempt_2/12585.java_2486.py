Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class VariableSizeException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, msg, force=False):
        super().__init__(msg)
        self.force = force

    @property
    def can_force(self):
        return self.force


# Example usage:
try:
    # Your operation that may raise the exception
except VariableSizeException as e:
    if e.can_force:
        print("The operation could be successful if forced.")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this Python code, we define a custom `VariableSizeException` class that inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`. The exception has two constructors (`__init__`) and one property (`can_force`). 

The first constructor takes only the message as an argument (like in Java), while the second constructor also accepts a boolean value for `force`.

In the example usage, we demonstrate how to catch this custom exception. If the exception is raised during execution of your code, you can check if it's possible to force the operation by checking the `can_force` property.
