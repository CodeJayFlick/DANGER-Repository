This code defines a `Memory` class that provides methods for reading and writing data to/from a database using various types of storage (e.g., files, arrays). The class also includes several overloaded versions of these methods with different parameters.

The main method is the `deleteFileBytes()` method which takes in a file bytes object as an argument. This method checks if any memory blocks are referenced and returns true or false accordingly.
```
public boolean deleteFileBytes(FileBytes fileBytes) throws IOException {
    // Check if any memory blocks are referenced
    return !fileBytes.isReferenced();
}
```

The `isReferenced()` method is used to check if a block of data in the database has been written. This method returns true or false depending on whether the block has been written.
```
public boolean isReferenced() {
    // Check if any memory blocks are referenced
    return !fileBytes.isWritten();
}
```

The `isWritten()` method checks if a block of data in the database has been written and returns true or false accordingly.

This code provides methods for reading and writing data to/from a database using various types of storage (e.g., files, arrays). The class also includes several overloaded versions of these methods with different parameters. It is used by `deleteFileBytes()` method which takes in a file bytes object as an argument.
```
public boolean deleteFileBytes(FileBytes fileBytes) throws IOException {
    // Check if any memory blocks are referenced
