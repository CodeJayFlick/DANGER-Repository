Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```
class BlockDoWhile:
    def __init__(self):
        self.blocktype = "DOWHILE"

# Note: In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's package declaration.
# We can use modules or classes as namespace separators if needed.

# The comment block is not translated into code. It provides documentation for the class in Java.
