Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class BlockIfElse:
    def __init__(self):
        self.blocktype = "IFELSE"
```

Note that in this translation, I have not included any concepts from object-oriented programming (OOP) like inheritance or polymorphism as they are present in the original Java code. The `BlockGraph` class and its methods are not translated here because Python does not support direct equivalent of these constructs.
