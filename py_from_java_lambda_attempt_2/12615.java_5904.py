Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class BlockInfLoop:
    def __init__(self):
        self.blocktype = "INFLOOP"
```

Note that this Python class does not have any equivalent concept for `BlockGraph` or `PcodeBlock`, as these are specific to Java and its related libraries.
