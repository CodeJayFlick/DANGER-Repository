Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class BlockList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.blocktype = "LIST"
```

Note that this is a simplified version as there are no direct equivalents for some Java concepts in Python, such as `public`, `extends`, and `super()`.
