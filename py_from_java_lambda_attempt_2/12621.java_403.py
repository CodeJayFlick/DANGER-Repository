Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class BlockWhileDo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.blocktype = "WHILEDO"
```

Note that in this translation, I have removed all the unnecessary comments as they are not relevant to the actual functionality. Also, there is no direct equivalent of `package` and `public class` declarations in Python.
