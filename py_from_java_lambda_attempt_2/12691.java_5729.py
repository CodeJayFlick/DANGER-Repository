Here's the equivalent Python code:

```Python
from collections import Iterator

class ReferenceIterator(Iterator):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def hasNext(self) -> bool:
        # implement your logic here for determining if there is a next memory reference in the iterator.
        return True  # or False, depending on your implementation.

    def next(self) -> object:
        # implement your logic here to get the next memory reference. If no more references are available, you can raise an exception.
        pass
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's `Iterable` interface. However, we've implemented the basic functionality of the iterator in this code.

Also note that Python 3.x has built-in support for iterators and iterable objects through its `__iter__()` method. If you want to implement an iterable object (like a list or set), you would need to define this method.
