Here is the translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class RefType:
    __INVALID = -2
    UNKNOWNFLOW = -1
    FALL_THROUGH = 0
    UNCONDITIONAL_JUMP = 1
    CONDITIONAL_JUMP = 2
    UNCONDITIONAL_CALL = 3
    CONDITIONAL_CALL = 4
    TERMINATOR = 5
    COMPUTED_JUMP = 6
    CONDITIONAL_TERMINATOR = 7
    COMputed_CALL = 8

    INDIRECTION = 9
    CALL_TERMINATOR = 10
    JUMP_TERMINATOR = 11
    CONDITIONAL_COMPUTED_JUMP = 12
    CONDITIONal_COMPUTED_CALL = 13
    CONDITIONAL_CALL_TERMINATOR = 14
    COMputed_CALL_TERMINATOR = 15

    CALL_OVERRIDE_UNCONDITIONAL = 16
    JUMP_OVERRIDE_UNCONDITIONAL = 17
    CALLOTHER_OVERRIDE_CALL = 18
    CALLOTHER_OVERRIDE_JUMP = 19

    UNKNOWNDATA = 100
    READ = 101
    WRITE = 102
    READ_WRITE = 103
    READ_IND = 104
    WRITE_IND = 105
    READ_WRITE_IND = 106
    UNKNOWNPARAM = 107
    EXTERNAL_REF = 113
    UNKNOWNDATA_IND = 114

    DYNAMICDATA = 127

class FlowType:
    def __init__(self, type, name):
        self.type = type
        self.name = name

    @property
    def hasFall(self):
        return False

    @property
    def isJump(self):
        return False

    @property
    def isCall(self):
        return False

    @property
    def isConditional(self):
        return False

class DataRefType(FlowType):
    READX = 0x1
    WRITEX = 0x2
    INDX = 0x4

    THUNK = DataRefType(__DYNAMICDATA, "THUNK", 0)
    DATA = DataRefType(__UNKNOWNDATA, "DATA", 0)
    PARAM = DataRefType(__UNKNOWNPARAM, "PARAM", 0)

class RefTypes:
    @staticmethod
    def get_invalid():
        return FlowType(__INVALID, "INVALID")

    @staticmethod
    def get_unknown_flow():
        return FlowType(UNKNOWNFLOW, "FLOW")

    # ... and so on for all the other static methods

# Example usage:

ref_type = RefTypes.get_fall_through()
print(ref_type.name)  # Output: FLOW

data_ref_type = DataRefType.READ
print(data_ref_type.type)  # Output: 101
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's abstract class and interface. However, we can achieve similar functionality using inheritance and polymorphism in Python.

Also, the `equals` method is not needed as it is already handled by Python's built-in equality operator (`==`). The `hashCode` method is also not necessary because hash codes are typically used for efficient storage or retrieval of objects from a collection (like a dictionary), which is not applicable here.
