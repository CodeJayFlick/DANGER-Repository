Here is the translation of the Java interface `GraphDisplayProvider` into a Python class:

```python
class GraphDisplayProvider:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # Initialize with default values or None if not applicable in Python

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        """The name of this provider (for displaying as menu option when graphing)."""
        return ""  # Replace with actual implementation

    def get_graph_display(
            self, reuse_graph: bool, monitor: "TaskMonitor" = None
    ) -> "GraphDisplay":
        """
        Returns a GraphDisplay that can be used to display or otherwise consume the graph.

        :param reuse_graph: If true, this provider will attempt to re-use an existing GraphDisplay.
        :param monitor: The TaskMonitor that can be used to monitor and cancel the operation.
        :return: A GraphDisplay that can be used to display (or otherwise consume - e.g. export) the graph.
        :raises: GraphException if there is a problem creating a GraphDisplay
        """
        raise NotImplementedError  # Replace with actual implementation

    def initialize(self, tool: "PluginTool", options: dict):
        """Provides an opportunity for this provider to register and read tool options."""
        pass  # Initialize or process the provided options as needed in Python

    def options_changed(self, options: dict):
        """
        Called if the graph options change.

        :param options: The current tool options
        """
        pass  # Process any changes made to the options as needed in Python

    def dispose(self) -> None:
        """Disposes this GraphDisplayProvider."""
        pass  # Clean up or release resources held by the provider, if applicable

    @property
    def help_location(self) -> "HelpLocation":
        """
        Gets the help location for this GraphDisplayProvider.
        :return: Help location for this GraphDisplayProvider
        """
        return None  # Replace with actual implementation
```

Note that I've used Python's built-in `@property` decorator to create read-only properties for the `name`, and `help_location`. This is equivalent to Java's getter methods.
