Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class FakeLineArrayListWriter:
    def new_line(self):
        pass

    def write(self, cbuf: bytes, off: int, len: int) -> None:
        pass
```
Note that I've used the `pass` statement in both methods since they are intended to do nothing. In Python, we don't need explicit return statements or exception handling like Java does.

Also, I've converted the method signature from Java-style (`public void newLine()`) to Python's more concise syntax (just using the method name and parameters).
