Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class ProgramDecisionTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.constraints = {}
        
        from ghidra.util.constraint import ProgramConstraint
        for constraint_class in ProgramConstraint.__subclasses__():
            try:
                constraint_instance = constraint_class()
                self.register_constraint_type(constraint_instance.name, constraint_class)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Can't create constraint instance for {constraint_class.__name__}: {e}")

    def register_constraint_type(self, name: str, constraint_class):
        pass  # This method is not implemented in the given Java code

# Note that this Python translation does not include all methods and classes from the original Java code.
```

This Python code defines a `ProgramDecisionTree` class with an initializer (`__init__`) that iterates over subclasses of `ProgramConstraint`, attempts to create instances, and registers them. The `register_constraint_type` method is left unimplemented as it was not provided in the given Java code.

Please note that this translation assumes you have access to the same classes (e.g., `ProgramConstraint`, etc.) in your Python environment as they were used in the original Java code.
