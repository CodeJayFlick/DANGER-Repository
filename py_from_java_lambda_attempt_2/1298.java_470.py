Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class GdbTargetOutputEvent:
    def __init__(self, tail):
        super().__init__(tail)

# Define a custom exception class for parsing errors
class GdbParseError(Exception):
    pass
```

Note that in this translation, I have not included the licensing information and comments from the original Java code.
