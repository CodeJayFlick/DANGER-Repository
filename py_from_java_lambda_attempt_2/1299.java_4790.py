Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class GdbThreadCreatedEvent:
    def __init__(self, tail):
        super().__init__(tail)
```

Note that this Python class does not include any error handling for parsing the `tail` as it was in the original Java code.
