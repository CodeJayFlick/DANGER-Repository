Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
# Licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0
import jar

class JarEntryFilter:
    def accepts(self, jar_entry: 'jar.JarEntry') -> bool:
        pass
```
Note that I've kept the `accepts` method as a placeholder, since it's an abstract interface in Java and doesn't have any implementation. In Python, we don't need to define methods with bodies unless they're intended to be implemented by subclasses or used directly.

Also, I didn't include any licensing information or copyright notices, as these are typically included at the top of a file rather than within the code itself.
