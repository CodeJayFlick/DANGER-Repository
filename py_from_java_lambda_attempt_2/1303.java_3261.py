Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class GdbThreadGroupRemovedEvent:
    def __init__(self, tail):
        super().__init__(tail)
```

Note that this is a simplified version as it does not include error handling for `GdbParseError` and also assumes that there's an abstract class called `AbstractGdbThreadGroupEvent`.
