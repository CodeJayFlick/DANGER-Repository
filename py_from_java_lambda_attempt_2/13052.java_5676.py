Here is the translation of the Java interface `Fixup` into a Python class:

```python
class Fixup:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_description(self) -> str:
        """Returns a description of what this Fixup does."""
        # TO DO: implement me!
        return ""

    def can_fixup(self) -> bool:
        """Return true if this Fixup object can automatically perform some action to address the issue. False otherwise."""
        # TO DO: implement me!
        return False

    def fixup(self, provider):
        """Attempts to perform some action or task to "fix" the related issue."""
        # TO DO: implement me!
        pass
```

Note that I've kept the method names and signatures similar to the original Java code. However, Python is a dynamically-typed language, so you don't need to specify types for variables or function parameters (I've left them in as comments). Also, Python doesn't have an equivalent concept of interfaces like Java does; instead, we define classes with methods that can be implemented by other classes.
