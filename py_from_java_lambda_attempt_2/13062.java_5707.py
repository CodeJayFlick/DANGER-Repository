Here's the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class CancelledListener:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def cancelled(self):
        """Provides notification when a task is cancelled."""
        pass
```

Note that in this translation, I've kept the `cancelled` method as it was in the original Java interface. This means that any class implementing this Python class will need to provide its own implementation of the `cancelled` method if they want to respond to cancellation events.
