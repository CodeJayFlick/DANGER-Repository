Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```
from typing import TypeVar, Generic, Callable, Exception

class ExceptionalFunction(Generic[I, R]):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @Generic.register
    class _Callable(Callable[[I], R]):
        def apply(self, i: I) -> R:
            raise NotImplementedError("This method must be implemented")

ExceptionalFunction = type('ExceptionalFunction', (ExceptionalFunction,), {'_Callable': _Callable})
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `@FunctionalInterface` annotation. The above code defines an abstract class `ExceptionalFunction` with a nested `_Callable` class, which is intended to be used as a functional interface in the same way that the original Java code uses it.

Also note that Python 3.5 and later versions have built-in support for type hints using the `typing` module, which allows you to specify the types of function parameters and return values. The above code uses these type hints to define the generic types `I`, `R`, and `E`.
