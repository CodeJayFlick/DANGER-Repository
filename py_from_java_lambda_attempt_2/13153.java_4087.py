Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class ArrayLengthTest:
    def get_length(self, array: list) -> int:
        return len(array)
```

Note that in Python, we don't need a `public` keyword to define methods or variables. Also, since lists are built-in data structures in Python and do not require explicit declaration of their length like arrays do in Java, the method simply returns the length of the list using the built-in `len()` function.
