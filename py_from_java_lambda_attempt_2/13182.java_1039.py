Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class MonitorTest:
    def get_hash_code(self, o):
        if isinstance(o, object):
            return hash(o)
        else:
            raise TypeError("Input must be an instance of 'object'")

    def get_hash_code2(self, o):
        x = 0
        try:
            with lock():
                x = hash(o)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return x

lock = threading.Lock()
```

Please note that Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's `synchronized` keyword. Instead, we use the built-in `hash()` function to get the hash code of an object and the `with lock():` statement from the `threading` module to achieve thread safety in multi-threaded environments.

Also, Python has its own way of handling exceptions using try-except blocks.
