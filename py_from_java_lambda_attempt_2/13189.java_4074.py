Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
print("\u0024\U00a5\u00a2\u20ac")
print("\u00a5\u00a2\u20ac")

def test1():
    return "input1"

def test2():
    return len("input1")
```

Note that in the print statements, I used Python's built-in `print()` function. Also, note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `System.out.println()`.
