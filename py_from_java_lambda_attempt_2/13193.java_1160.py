Here is the translation of the given C++ code into Python:

```Python
class WideInc:
    def wide_inc(self, x):
        y = x
        y += 4660
        return y
```

Note that in this translation, I have replaced `public` with nothing (since there's no equivalent concept in Python), and the method signature is slightly different. Also, hexadecimal numbers are represented as integers in Python, so `0x1234` becomes `4660`.
