Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class InjectPayloadJava:
    def __init__(self, source_name: str, language: object, unique_base: int):
        self.language = language
        self.unique_base = unique_base

    @staticmethod
    def get_constant_pool(program: object) -> list or None:
        try:
            analysis_state = ClassFileAnalysisState.get_state(program)
            class_file = analysis_state.get_class_file()
            return class_file.constant_pool
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
            return None

# Example usage:

class SleighLanguage:
    pass  # This is a placeholder for the actual Java class. In Python, you can create your own equivalent class.

program = "example_program"
unique_base = 12345
language = SleighLanguage()

inject_payload_java = InjectPayloadJava(program, language, unique_base)
constant_pool = inject_payload_java.get_constant_pool("path_to_your_program")
```

Please note that this translation is not a direct conversion from Java to Python. The equivalent code in Python may look different due to the differences between the two languages and their respective syntaxes.

In particular:

- In Java, you have classes for `SleighLanguage`, `ClassFileAnalysisState`, etc., which are abstract concepts or interfaces that can be implemented by concrete classes. In Python, these would typically be represented as regular classes with methods.
- The equivalent of the Java class hierarchy (e.g., extending a superclass) is not directly translatable to Python's syntax. Instead, you might use composition or inheritance in your own code.
- Some Java-specific concepts like `IOException` and `AbstractConstantPoolInfoJava[]` do not have direct equivalents in Python.

This translation should give you an idea of how the original Java code could be implemented using equivalent constructs in Python.
