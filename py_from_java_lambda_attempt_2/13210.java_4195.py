Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class InjectPutStatic:
    def __init__(self, source_name: str, language: any, uniq_base: int):
        pass  # super().__init__(source_name, language, uniq_base)

    def get_pcode(self, program: any, con: any) -> list:
        constant_pool = []  # equivalent to AbstractConstantPoolInfoJava[]
        constant_pool_index = int(con.inputlist[0].get_offset())  # assuming inputlist is a list of some sort
        p_code = PcodeOpEmitter(language, con.base_addr, uniq_base)
        ReferenceMethods.get_pcode_for_put_static(p_code, constant_pool_index, constant_pool)  # equivalent to getPcodeForPutStatic method
        return p_code.get_pcode_ops()  # assuming get_pcode_ops is a method in the PcodeOpEmitter class

class PcodeOpEmitter:
    def __init__(self, language: any, base_addr: int, uniq_base: int):
        pass  # equivalent to constructor of SleighLanguage and uniqueBase

    def get_pcode_ops(self) -> list:
        return []  # assuming this method returns a list of some sort
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java classes like `SleighLanguage`, `AbstractConstantPoolInfoJava` or methods like `getPcodeForPutStatic`. These would need to be replaced with equivalent constructs in the target language.
