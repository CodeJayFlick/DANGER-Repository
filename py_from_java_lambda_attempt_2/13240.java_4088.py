Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
import io


class InnerClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.inner_class_info_index = 0
        self.outer_class_info_index = 0
        self.inner_name_index = 0
        self.inner_class_access_flags = 0

    def from_binary_reader(self, reader: 'io.BinaryReader') -> None:
        if not isinstance(reader, io.BinaryReader):
            raise TypeError("reader must be an instance of BinaryReader")
        self.inner_class_info_index = reader.read_next_short()
        self.outer_class_info_index = reader.read_next_short()
        self.inner_name_index = reader.read_next_short()
        self.inner_class_access_flags = reader.read_next_short()

    def get_inner_class_info_index(self) -> int:
        return self.inner_class_info_index & 0xffff

    def get_outer_class_info_index(self) -> int:
        return self.outer_class_info_index & 0xffff

    def get_inner_name_index(self) -> int:
        return self.inner_name_index & 0xffff

    def get_inner_class_access_flags(self) -> int:
        return self.inner_class_access_flags


class BinaryReader:
    pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `short` type. It has built-in integer types like `int`, `long`, etc., but no specific short type. So, I used the default 32-bit signed integer (`int`) for representing these values in this translation.

Also, please be aware that there is a difference between Python and Java regarding how they handle binary data reading. In Java, you can directly read binary data using `readNextShort()` method of `BinaryReader`. However, in Python, we would typically use the built-in file operations (`open()`, `read()`) or libraries like `struct` to achieve this.

Lastly, note that I did not include any specific implementation for reading from a BinaryReader as it is not provided in your original Java code.
