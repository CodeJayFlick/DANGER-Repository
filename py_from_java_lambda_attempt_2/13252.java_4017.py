Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class RuntimeInvisibleAnnotationsAttribute:
    def __init__(self):
        self.numberOf_annotations = None
        self.annotations = []

    def read_from_binary_reader(self, reader):
        super().__init__()
        self.numberOf_annotations = reader.read_short()
        for _ in range(self.get_number_of_annotations()):
            annotation = AnnotationJava(reader)
            self.annotations.append(annotation)

    def get_number_of_annotations(self):
        return self.numberOf_annotations & 0xffff

    def get_annotations(self):
        return self.annotations


class AnnotationJava:
    pass
```

Please note that this is a simplified translation, as Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's classes and methods. The above code provides the basic structure of the given Java class in Python.

Here are some key differences between the original Java code and its equivalent Python version:

1. Inheritance: Python does not support inheritance using `extends` keyword like Java. Instead, you can use composition or multiple inheritance to achieve similar results.
2. Method Overriding: Python supports method overriding through polymorphism (method overloading) but it's different from the way Java handles it.
3. Exception Handling: Python has its own exception handling mechanism which is different from Java's try-catch block structure.

The above code does not include any implementation for `AnnotationJava` class as per your request, I have left that part empty in this translation.
