Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class ConstantPoolMethodReferenceInfo:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def to_data_type(self) -> dict:
        structure = {}
        try:
            structure['name'] = "CONSTANT_Methodref_info"
        except Exception as e:
            raise ValueError(str(e))
        return structure


# Usage
reader = None  # Replace with your reader object
constant_pool_method_reference_info = ConstantPoolMethodReferenceInfo()
data_type = constant_pool_method_reference_info.to_data_type()

```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `BinaryReader`, `DataType`, and other classes. I've replaced them with more general concepts in the above code, which is a simple dictionary for representing data type.

Also, Python doesn't support checked exceptions like Java. So, I used `ValueError` to represent any kind of exception that might occur during execution.
