Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import unittest

class MIPS64R6_O3_EmulatorTest:
    LANGUAGE_ID = "MIPS:BE:64:R6"
    COMPILER_SPEC_ID = "default"

    REG_DUMP_SET = []

    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name, self.LANGUAGE_ID, self.COMPILER_SPEC_ID, self.REG_DUMP_SET)

    @property
    def processor_designator(self):
        return "MIPS64R6_ GCC_O3"


def suite():
    return unittest.makeSuite(MIPS64R6_O3_EmulatorTest)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()
    test_suite = MIPS64R6_O3_EmulatorTest("test_name")
    runner.run(test_suite)
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `@Override` annotation. It is used to indicate that a method is overriding a method in the parent class, but it is not enforced by the compiler or interpreter.

Also, Python does not support static methods like Java. The equivalent would be using a regular function and accessing its attributes through the class itself (e.g., `MIPS64R6_O3_EmulatorTest.suite()`).
