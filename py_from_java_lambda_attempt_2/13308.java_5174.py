Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import unittest

LANGUAGE_ID = "MIPS:BE:64:64-32addr"
COMPILER_SPEC_ID = "default"

class MIPS64_32addr_O0_EmulatorTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def __init__(self, name="test_MIPS64_32addr_O0_Emulator"):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.language_id = LANGUAGE_ID
        self.compiler_spec_id = COMPILER_SPEC_ID

    def get_processor_designator(self):
        return "MIPS64_32addr_GCC_O0"

def suite():
    return unittest.makeSuite(MIPS64_32addr_O0_EmulatorTest)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()
    runner.run(suite())
```
Note that I've used the `unittest` module to define a test case and a test suite, which is similar to the Java code. However, Python's syntax and semantics are quite different from Java's, so some changes were necessary to translate the code correctly.

In particular:

* The `public class` declaration becomes simply `class`.
* The `private static final String[] REG_DUMP_SET = new String[] {};" line is not needed in Python.
* The constructor (`public MIPS64_32addr_O0_EmulatorTest(String name)`) becomes an initializer method (`__init__(self, name="test_MIPS64_32addr_O0_Emulator")`).
* The `@Override` annotation is not necessary in Python, as it's implied by the fact that we're overriding a method.
* The `public static Test suite()` method becomes simply `def suite():`.
* The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is used to run the test suite when the script is executed directly (i.e., not imported as a module).
