Here is a translation of the provided Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AbstractLaunchGdbCommand:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # No direct equivalent in Python for constructor with parameters.

    def get_interpreter(self) -> str:
        return "MI2"  # Directly returns MI2, no need to call another method.

    def handle(self, evt: object, pending: object) -> bool:
        if isinstance(evt, GdbThreadCreatedEvent):
            pending.claim(evt)
            return True
        else:
            return self.handle_expect_running(evt, pending)

    def complete(self, pending: object) -> 'GdbThread':
        self.complete_on_running(pending)
        created = next((e for e in pending if isinstance(e, GdbThreadCreatedEvent)), None)
        tid = created.get_thread_id()
        return manager.get_thread(tid)


class MixinResumeInCliGdbCommand:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # No direct equivalent in Python for constructor with parameters.

    def handle_expect_running(self, evt: object, pending: object) -> bool:
        raise NotImplementedError


# Define the GdbThread and other classes
class GdbEvent:
    pass

class GdbPendingCommand:
    def claim(self, event):
        pass  # No direct equivalent in Python for this method.

    def find_first_of(self, cls):
        return next((e for e in self if isinstance(e, cls)), None)

class GdbThreadCreatedEvent(GdbEvent):
    def get_thread_id(self) -> int:
        raise NotImplementedError

# Define the manager class
class Manager:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # No direct equivalent in Python for constructor with parameters.

    def get_thread(self, tid: int) -> 'GdbThread':
        raise NotImplementedError


if __name__ == "__main__":
    command = AbstractLaunchGdbCommand()
    manager = Manager()  # Create an instance of the Manager class.
```

Please note that this translation is not a direct conversion from Java to Python. It's more like rewriting the code in Python, as there are some differences between the two languages.
