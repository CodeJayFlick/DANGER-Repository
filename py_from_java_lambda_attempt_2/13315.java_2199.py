Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import unittest

class MIPSMICROMIX_O3_EmulatorTest:
    LANGUAGE_ID = "MIPS:BE:32:micro"
    COMPILER_SPEC_ID = "default"

    REG_DUMP_SET = []

    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name, self.LANGUAGE_ID, self.COMPILER_SPEC_ID, self.REG_DUMP_SET)

    @property
    def processor_designator(self):
        return "MIPSMICMIX_GCC_O3"

def suite():
    return unittest.makeSuite(MIPSMICROMIX_O3_EmulatorTest)
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `@Override` annotation. The `processor_designator` method is defined as a property in the above code, which serves similar purpose to the overridden method in Java.

Also note that there are some differences between Python and Java syntax. For example, Python uses indentation instead of curly braces for block-level structure, it does not have explicit constructor declaration like Java's `public MIPSMICROMIX_ O3_EmulatorTest(String name)`, etc.
