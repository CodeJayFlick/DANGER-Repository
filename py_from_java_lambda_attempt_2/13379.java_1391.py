Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
class ElfSH4RelocationFixupHandler:
    def process_relocation(self, program: 'Program', relocation: 'Relocation', old_image_base: int, new_image_base: int) -> bool:
        if relocation.get_type() in [0x6, 0xd, 0xe, 0xf]:
            return self.process_32_bit_relocation(program, relocation, old_image_base, new_image_base)
        return False

    def process_handles_program(self, program: 'Program') -> bool:
        if not isinstance(program.get_executable_format(), str) or "ELF" != program.get_executable_format():
            return False
        language = program.get_language()
        processor = language.get_processor()
        return ("SuperH4" == str(processor)) or ("SuperH" == str(processor))

class Program:
    def __init__(self, executable_format: str):
        self.executable_format = executable_format

class Relocation:
    def get_type(self) -> int:
        pass  # implement this method in your subclass
```

Note that I had to make some assumptions about the Python code. For example:

- In Java, `program` and `relocation` are objects of certain classes (`Program` and `Relocation`, respectively). In Python, these would be instances of those classes.
- The methods `process_relocation` and `handles_program` in Java return a boolean value indicating whether the relocation was processed or not. In Python, I used the same approach.

This code is written assuming that you have subclasses for `Program` and `Relocation`, which implement their respective methods (`get_executable_format`, `get_language`, etc.).
