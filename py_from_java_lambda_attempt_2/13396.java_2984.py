Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
class X86_32_Elf_Relocation_Constants:
    R_386_NONE = 0  # No calculation
    R_386_PC32 = 2  # S + A - P
    R_386_GOT32 = 3  # G + A - P
    R_386_PLT32 = 4  # L + A - P
    R_386_COPY = 5  # No calculation
    R_386_GLOB_DAT = 6  # S
    R_386_JMP_SLOT = 7  # S
    R_386_RELATIVE = 8  # B + A
    R_386_GOTOFF = 9  # S + A - GOT
    R_386_GOTPC = 10  # GOT + A - P
    R_386_TLS_TPOFF = 14  # negative offset in static TLS block
    R_386_TLS_IE = 15  # absolute address of GOT entry for negative static TLS block offset
    R_386_TLS_GOTIE = 16  # GOT entry for negative static TLS block offset
    R_386_TLS_LE = 17  # negative offset relative to static TLS
    R_386_TLS_GD = 18  # direct 32 bit for GNU version of GD TLS
    R_386_TLS_LDM = 19  # direct 32 bit for GNU version of LD TLS in LE code
    R_386_TLS_GD_32 = 24  # direct 32 bit for GD TLS
    R_386_TLS_GD_PUSH = 25  # tag for pushl in GD TLS code
    R_386_TLS_GD_CALL = 26  # relocation for call 
    R_386_TLS_GD_POP = 27  # tag for popl in GD TLS code
    R_386_TLS_LDM_32 = 28  # direct 32 bit for local dynamic code
    R_386_TLS_LDM_PUSH = 29  # tag for pushl in LDM TLS code
    R_386_TLS_LDM_CALL = 30  # relocation for call 
    R_386_TLS_LDM_POP = 31  # tag for popl in LDM TLS code
    R_386_TLS_LDO_32 = 32  # offset relative to TLS block
    R_386_TLS_IE_32 = 33  # got entry for static TLS block
    R_386_TLS_LE_32 = 34  # offset relative to static TLS block
    R_386_TLS_DTPMOD32 = 35  # ID of module containing symbol
    R_386_TLS_DTPOFF32 = 36  # offset in TLS block
    R_386_TLS_TPOFF32 = 37  # offset in static TLS block
    R_386_TLS_GOTDESC = 39  # GOT offset for TLS descriptor.   
    R_386_TLS_DESC_CALL = 40  # Marker of call through TLS descriptor for relaxation.   
    R_386_TLS_DESC = 41  # TLS descriptor containing pointer to code and to argument, returning the TLS offset for the symbol.   
    R_386_IRELATIVE = 42  # Adjust indirectly by program base   

    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `public static final` keywords. The constants are defined as class attributes, and there is no need for a constructor in this case since the class has no instance variables or methods.
