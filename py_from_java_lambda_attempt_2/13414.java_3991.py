Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import pyautogui
import time
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Controller

# Initialize keyboard controller
keyboard = Controller()

def capture_screenshot():
    # Set window size to 1000x800 pixels
    pyautogui.size(1000, 800)

    # Move cursor to the top of the listing at address 0x00405120 and then move it to the specified position (0x0040512e)
    pyautogui.moveTo(0x00405120, 0)  # This might not work as expected
    time.sleep(1)
    pyautogui.moveTo(0x0040512e, 0)

    # Add AssemblerPlugin to the tool
    keyboard.press('right')
    keyboard.release('right')

    # Perform "Assemble" action with the plugin
    keyboard.press('ctrl')  # Assuming this is equivalent to VK_CONTROL on Windows and Command key on Mac
    keyboard.press('space')
    keyboard.release('space')
    time.sleep(1)
    keyboard.release('ctrl')

    # Release escape key after a short delay
    time.sleep(0.5)  # This might not work as expected
    keyboard.press('esc')
    keyboard.release('esc')

    # Capture screenshot using CodeViewerProvider (equivalent to captureProvider in Java)
    pyautogui.screenshot()

# Call the function
capture_screenshot()
```

Please note that this Python code is a translation of your original Java code, but it might not work exactly as expected. You may need to adjust some parts based on how you want to interact with your application and system.
