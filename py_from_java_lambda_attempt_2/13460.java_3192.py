Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```python
import os

class MergeScreenShotGenerator:
    def __init__(self, test_filename: str, mtf: object):
        self.test_name = None  # equivalent to testName in Java
        self.test_filename = test_filename
        self.mtf = mtf

    def set_tool(self, tool: object) -> None:
        pass  # no direct equivalent in Python, but can be used as a property setter

    def setup(self) -> None:
        env = self.mtf.get_test_environment()  # assuming get_test_environment is a method
        return env

    def get_help_topic(self) -> str:
        simple_name = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(self.test_filename))[0].replace("ScreenShots", "")
        help_topic_dir = f"{simple_name}/"  # equivalent to getHelpTopicDir in Java
        assert self.mtf.get_test_environment() is not None, "Unable to find help topic for test file: " + self.test_filename
        return help_topic_dir

# Example usage:
mtf = object()  # assuming MergeTestFacilitator is a class with an instance method get_test_environment()
test_filename = "some_file"
merge_screenshot_generator = MergeScreenShotGenerator(test_filename, mtf)
print(merge_screenshot_generator.get_help_topic())
```
Note that I've made some assumptions about the Python code:

* The `MergeTestFacilitator` is a class with an instance method `get_test_environment()`.
* The `GhidraScreenShotGenerator` is not used in this translation, as it's not present in the original Java code.
* Some methods and variables have been renamed or reworked to fit Python syntax and conventions.

Please let me know if you'd like me to clarify any of these assumptions!
