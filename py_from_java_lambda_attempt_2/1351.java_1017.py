Here's a translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class GdbListAvailableProcessesCommand:
    def __init__(self, manager):
        pass  # Assuming 'manager' is an instance of some class that has methods/attributes used in this command.

    def encode(self):
        return "-list-thread-groups --available"

    def complete(self, pending):
        if isinstance(pending, dict):  # Assuming the equivalent of GdbPendingCommand<?> is a dictionary.
            done = pending.get("done", None)
            if done:
                return [GdbProcessThreadGroup()]  # Assuming 'GdbProcessThreadGroup' is some class that represents available processes.
