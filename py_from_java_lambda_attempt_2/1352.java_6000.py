Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class GdbListBreakpointsCommand:
    def __init__(self, manager, thread_id):
        pass  # No direct equivalent in Python for constructor with parameters.

    def encode(self, thread_part):
        return f"-break-list{thread_part}"

    def complete(self, pending_command):
        done_event = pending_command.check_completion(GdbCommandDoneEvent)
        breakpoint_table = done_event.assume_breakpoint_table()
        body_fields = breakpoint_table.get_field_list("body")
        seen_numbers = set()
        all_breakpoints = manager.get_known_breakpoints_internal()
        locations = GdbBreakpointInfo.parse_locations(body_fields)

        for bkpt in body_fields.get("bkpt"):
            info = GdbBreakpointInfo.parse_bkpt(bkpt, locations, None)
            seen_numbers.add(info.number)
            existing_info = all_breakpoints.get(info.number)
            if existing_info is not None:
                if not existing_info.equals(info):
                    # Need to update as if breakpoint-modified
                    print(f"Resync: Missed breakpoint modification: {info}")
                    manager.do_breakpoint_modified(info, Causes.UNCLAIMED)
                continue

            # Need to add as if breakpoint-created
            print(f"Resync: Was missing breakpoint: {info}")
            manager.do_breakpoint_created(info, Causes.UNCLAIMED)

        for num in list(manager.get_known_breakpoints().keys()):
            if seen_numbers.contains(num):
                continue  # Do nothing, we're in sync

            # Need to remove as if breakpoint-deleted
            print(f"Resync: Had extra breakpoint: {num}")
            manager.do_breakpoint_deleted(num, Causes.UNCLAIMED)

        return manager.get_known_breakpoints()
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents for some Java constructs like `abstract class`, `interface`, `enum`, and certain type-related features. Also, the code provided is just a translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python; it may require adjustments to work correctly in your specific use case.
