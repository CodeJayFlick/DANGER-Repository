Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

class CircularServiceB:
    pass


def main():
    # No equivalent for Java's @ServiceInfo annotation
    # Python does not have direct support for annotations like Java, but you can use docstrings or comments to provide information about your class.
    """
    Plugin service for circular dependency testing (PluginManagerTest.testCircularDependency())
    
    Test service
    """

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that Python does not have direct support for annotations like Java. The equivalent of the `@ServiceInfo` annotation in this case is a docstring or comment, which provides information about your class.
