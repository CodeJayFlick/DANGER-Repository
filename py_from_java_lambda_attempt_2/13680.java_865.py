Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, properties):
        pass  # Assuming AbstractDocument class has an implementation for this method.

# No direct mapping available in Python as there's no built-in support for interfaces like 'HasModel', 'HasPrice' and 'HasParts'. 
```

Please note that the given Java code is not a complete program. It only defines a `Car` class which extends another abstract class (`AbstractDocument`) and implements three interfaces (`HasModel`, `HasPrice`, and `HasParts`). 

Python does not have direct support for interfaces like in Java, so we cannot directly translate these interfaces into Python. However, if you want to achieve similar functionality using classes or protocols (in Python 3.5+), here's how:

```Python
class HasModel:
    pass

class HasPrice:
    pass

class HasParts:
    pass

class Car(metaclass=AbstractDocument):
    def __init__(self, properties):
        super().__init__(properties)
```

In this example, `HasModel`, `HasPrice` and `HasParts` are just classes (not interfaces) that can be used to define protocols.
