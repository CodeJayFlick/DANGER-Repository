Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python

class Army:
    """Army interface."""
    
    def get_description(self):
        pass
```

Note that in this translation, I have not included any specific implementation for the `get_description` method as it is an abstract method and should be implemented by concrete classes.
