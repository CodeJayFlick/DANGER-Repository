Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python

class Castle:
    """Castle interface."""
    
    def get_description(self):
        pass
```

Note that in this translation, I've kept the `get_description` method as a placeholder since it doesn't have any specific implementation. In Python, we don't need to specify the return type of methods like Java does with `String getDescription();`.
