Here's the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
# The MIT License
# Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Ilkka Seppälä

class ElfKing:
    """Elf King"""
    
    DESCRIPTION = "This is the elven king!"

    def get_description(self):
        return self.DESCRIPTION


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # You can create an instance of this class here
    pass
```

Please note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `package` statement. In Python, you would typically put your classes in separate modules (files) and import them as needed.

Also, the concept of interfaces is different between Java and Python. In Python, we use abstract base classes or duck typing instead.
