Here's the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class OrcArmy:
    """Orc Army."""
    
    description = "This is the orc army!"

    def get_description(self):
        return self.description


# Usage example:
army = OrcArmy()
print(army.get_description())
```

Please note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's `package` statement. The class definition itself serves as its own package.
