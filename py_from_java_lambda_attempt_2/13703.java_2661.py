Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
class OrcKingdomFactory:
    def create_castle(self):
        return OrcCastle()

    def create_king(self):
        return OrcKing()

    def create_army(self):
        return OrcArmy()


# Note: The following classes are not provided in the original Java code, so I assume they exist elsewhere.
class Castle:
    pass

class King:
    pass

class Army:
    pass

class OrcCastle(Castle):
    pass

class OrcKing(King):
    pass

class OrcArmy(Army):
    pass
```

Please note that this is a direct translation of the Java code to Python, and it may not be perfect. The classes `OrcCastle`, `OrcKing` and `OrcArmy` are assumed to exist elsewhere in your program, as they were missing from the original Java code.
