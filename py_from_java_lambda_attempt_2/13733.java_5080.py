Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "This test requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0
```

Note that the original Java code was using JUnit Jupiter for testing and `assertDoesNotThrow` to check if a method throws an exception. In Python, we use the built-in `unittest` module with its own assertion methods like `self.assertRaises`. The test case checks if calling `App.main([])` raises a `SystemExit` exception (which is what Java's main method does when it finishes executing).
