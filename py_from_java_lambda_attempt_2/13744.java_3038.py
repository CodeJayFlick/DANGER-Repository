Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import unittest

class TestInformationController(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_get_product_title(self):
        info_controller = InformationController()
        title = info_controller.get_product_title()
        self.assertEqual("The Product Title.", title)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `@Test` annotation. Instead, we define test methods using the `test_` prefix (as per PEP 8 conventions). The `unittest.TestCase` class provides various assertion methods like `assertEqual`, which is used here.

Also note that I've assumed you have an `InformationController` class defined elsewhere in your codebase, as there's no equivalent Java-style package declaration or import statement in Python.
