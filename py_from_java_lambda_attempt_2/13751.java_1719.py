Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python equivalent:

```Python
# No copyright notice or license statement needed in Python!

class RemoteServiceInterface:
    def do_remote_function(self, value: int) -> int:
        pass  # This method needs to be implemented by any class that inherits from this one.
```

Note that the `long` type is not a built-in type in Python. It's equivalent to an integer (`int`) or a floating point number (`float`).
