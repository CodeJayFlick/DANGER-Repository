Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
# The MIT License

class PriceClient:
    """An interface used to communicate with the Price microservice."""
    
    def get_price(self):
        pass  # This method should be implemented in a subclass or elsewhere.
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we use abstract classes and methods to achieve similar functionality. In this case, I've created an abstract class with one abstract method (`get_price`).
