Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python

import os

class ImageApplication:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

def main():
    # Start up Spring Boot, exposing endpoints for the Image microservice through the ImageController.
    print("Image Application started")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `@SpringBootApplication` or `@SpringApplication`. The code above is simply an example of how you might structure your application in Python.
