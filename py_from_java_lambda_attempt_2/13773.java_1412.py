Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import unittest

class TestPriceController(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_get_price(self):
        self.assertEqual("20", PriceController().get_price())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that this Python code does not include any equivalent to the original Java package declaration or import statements. In Python, these are typically omitted unless they're necessary for a specific module's functionality.
