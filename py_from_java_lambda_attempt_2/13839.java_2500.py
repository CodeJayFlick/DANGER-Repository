I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language instruction or statement, but rather a license agreement (MIT License) and package declaration in Java.

Since you asked me to "translate" it to Python, I will assume you meant to ask for a translation of the actual content within the file. If that's correct, please provide more context or code snippets from the original file, and I'll be happy to help with translating them into Python!
