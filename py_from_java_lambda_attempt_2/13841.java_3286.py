Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import unittest

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_should_execute_application_without_exception(self):
        try:
            App.main([])
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Exception occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
Note that I've used the `unittest` module in Python, which is similar to JUnit in Java. The test class inherits from `TestCase`, and each test method starts with the prefix `test_`. In this case, we're testing whether calling the `App.main()` function without arguments throws an exception.

The `assertDoesNotThrow` construct from Java doesn't have a direct equivalent in Python's unittest module. Instead, I've used a try-except block to catch any exceptions that might be raised by the `App.main()` call. If an exception is caught, we fail the test using the `self.fail()` method.

Finally, we use the `unittest.main()` function to run all tests defined in this script when it's executed as a standalone program (i.e., not imported as a module).
