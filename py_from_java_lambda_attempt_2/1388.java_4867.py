Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class GdbEndSteppingRangeReason:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # Nothing additional to parse

    def desc(self) -> str:
        return "Stepping ended"
```

Note that in this translation, I've removed the `GdbMiFieldList` parameter from the constructor as it is not used anywhere.
