Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_should_execute_application_without_exception(self):
        try:
            App.main([])
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"An exception occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `@Test` annotation. Instead, we define test methods inside a class that inherits from the `unittest.TestCase` class and use the `self.fail()` method to indicate failure if an exception is thrown during execution of the main function.

Also note that in Python, you would typically put your application logic into separate functions or classes rather than defining them as static methods within another class.
