Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class GdbExitNormallyReason:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        
    def desc(self):
        return "Exited normally (with code 0)"
```

Note that this Python class does not have any parameters in its constructor (`__init__` method), unlike the Java equivalent. Also, there is no `GdbMiFieldList` or `super(0)` as these are specific to Java and GDBMI parsing which doesn't exist in Python.
