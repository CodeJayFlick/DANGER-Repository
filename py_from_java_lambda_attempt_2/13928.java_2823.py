Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
class Sentence:
    def __init__(self, words):
        for word in words:
            self.add(word)

    @property
    def print_this_after(self):
        return ".\n"

# Note: The LetterComposite class and add method are not provided,
# so I assume they exist or can be implemented similarly.
```

This Python code defines a `Sentence` class with an initializer (`__init__`) that takes a list of words. It then iterates over the words, adding each one to itself (assuming there's an `add` method). The `print_this_after` property is equivalent to the Java method.

Please note that I've made some assumptions about the missing classes and methods in your original code. You may need to adjust this translation based on how you implement those parts.
