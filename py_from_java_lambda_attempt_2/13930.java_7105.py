Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('sys.stdout.write')
    def test_app(self, mock_stdout):
        try:
            App.main([])
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")
        else:
            pass  # No assertion needed here since we're testing for no exceptions

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `@Test` annotation. Instead, you would typically define test functions or methods within your class and use the `unittest` framework to run them.

In this translation, I've used the `patch` function from the `mock` module in the `unittest` package to mock out any output that might be written by the `App.main([])` call. This is because Python's built-in way of testing for exceptions (i.e., wrapping a block of code with a try/except statement) doesn't work well when you're trying to test whether an exception gets raised in response to some input.

In this case, I've used the fact that `App.main([])` should not raise any exceptions as my assertion.
