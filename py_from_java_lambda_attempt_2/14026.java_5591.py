Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class AdvancedWizard:
    def __init__(self, tobacco: 'Tobacco'):
        self.tobacco = tobacco

    def smoke(self):
        self.tobacco.smoke(self)
```

Note that in this translation, I have used type hints for `tobacco` and the return value of `smoke`, but Python does not enforce these types at runtime.
