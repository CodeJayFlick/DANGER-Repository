Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class SimpleWizard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tobacco = OldTobyTobacco()

    def smoke(self):
        self.tobacco.smoke(self)


class OldTobyTobacco:
    def smoke(self, wizard):
        pass  # implement the logic here


# Usage
wizard = SimpleWizard()
wizard.smoke()
```

Please note that this is a direct translation of Java code into Python. The `OldTobyTobacco` class in the original Java code seems to be missing its implementation (i.e., what it does when you call `smoke`). In the above Python code, I've left it as an abstract method (`pass`) for demonstration purposes only.
