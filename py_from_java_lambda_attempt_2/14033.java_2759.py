Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import logging

class Tobacco:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    def smoke(self, wizard: 'Wizard') -> None:
        self.logger.info("{} smoking {}".format(wizard.__class__.__name__, type(self).__name__))

```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's package and import statements. The `logging` module is used for logging in Python.

The `@Slf4j` annotation from Lombok is not directly translatable to Python, as it provides a way to automatically generate getter methods for static members like the logger field. In this case, we are manually creating an instance of the logger and assigning it to the class attribute.

Also note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's abstract classes or interfaces. The `Tobacco` class in Python is a regular class with no special meaning attached to its name.
