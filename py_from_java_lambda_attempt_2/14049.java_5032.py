Here is the translation of the Java interface `CustomerDao` to a Python class:

```python
from typing import Optional

class CustomerDAO:
    def find_by_name(self, name: str) -> Optional[dict]:
        # TO DO: implement database query or retrieval logic here
        pass  # Replace with actual implementation

    def update(self, customer: dict):
        # TO DO: implement database update logic here
        pass  # Replace with actual implementation

    def save(self, customer: dict):
        # TO DO: implement database insertion logic here
        pass  # Replace with actual implementation

    def add_product(self, product: dict, customer: dict) -> None:
        # TO DO: implement database update or insertion logic here
        pass  # Replace with actual implementation

    def delete_product(self, product: dict, customer: dict) -> None:
        # TO DO: implement database deletion logic here
        pass  # Replace with actual implementation
```

Note that I've replaced the `Customer` class with a dictionary type (`dict`) as Python does not have built-in support for interfaces or classes like Java. Additionally, I've left placeholder code in each method to indicate where you would need to implement your database logic using a library such as SQLAlchemy or psycopg2.
