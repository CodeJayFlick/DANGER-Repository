Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
# The MIT License
# Copyright (c) 2014-2021 Ilkka Seppälä

class AppConstants:
    """Class to define all constants."""
    
    HITS = "{} hits {}."
```

Note that in Python, we don't need a `public` keyword for classes or variables. Also, the copyright notice and permission statement are not strictly necessary in Python code, but I included them as they were present in the original Java file.
