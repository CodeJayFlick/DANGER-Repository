Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_app(self):
        try:
            App.main([])
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Exception occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that this is a simplified translation, and the original Java code had more complexity. This Python version does not include any assertions to check whether the execution of the main method throws an exception or not.
