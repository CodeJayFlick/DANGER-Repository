Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LordBaelishTest:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
```

Note that this Python class does not have any direct equivalents for some of the Java constructs used in the original code, such as `package`, `extends`, or specific method calls. The above translation is a simplified version of the given Java code into equivalent Python.

Here's what was left out:

- Package declaration: In Python, there are no explicit package declarations like you would find in Java.
- Class inheritance and type parameters: Since Python does not support generics (type parameters) or multiple inheritance directly, these constructs were omitted from this translation.
