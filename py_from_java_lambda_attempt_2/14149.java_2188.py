Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import logging
from typing import NoReturn

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Audio:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(Audio, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

    @classmethod
    def getInstance(cls) -> 'Audio':
        return cls._instance

    def getAudioStream(self, file_path: str) -> NoReturn:
        # implement your audio stream logic here
        pass

    def playSound(self, audio_stream: object, volume: float) -> None:
        # implement your sound playing logic here
        pass

    def stopService(self) -> None:
        # implement your service stopping logic here
        pass


def main() -> NoReturn:
    audio = Audio.getInstance()
    try:
        audio.playSound(audio.getAudioStream("./etc/Bass-Drum-1.wav"), -10.0)
        audio.playSound(audio.getAudioStream("./etc/Closed-Hi-Hat-1.wav"), -8.0)

        LOGGER.info("Press Enter key to stop the program...")
        input()  # wait for user's enter
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    finally:
        audio.stopService()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that this Python code is not a direct translation of your Java code. It's more like an equivalent implementation in Python, considering the differences between both languages and their respective standard libraries.
