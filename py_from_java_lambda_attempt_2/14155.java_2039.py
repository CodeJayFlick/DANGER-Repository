Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class AccountCreateEvent:
    def __init__(self, sequence_id: int, created_time: str, account_no: int, owner: str):
        self.sequence_id = sequence_id
        self.created_time = created_time
        self.account_no = account_no
        self.owner = owner

    @property
    def process(self) -> None:
        try:
            if AccountAggregate.get_account(self.account_no) is not None:
                raise ValueError("Account already exists")
            new_account = Account(self.account_no, self.owner)
            new_account.handle_event(self)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

class DomainEvent:
    def __init__(self, sequence_id: int, created_time: str, event_type: str):
        self.sequence_id = sequence_id
        self.created_time = created_time
        self.event_type = event_type

class AccountAggregate:
    @staticmethod
    def get_account(account_no: int) -> 'Account':
        # implement your logic here to retrieve the account from database or any other storage
        pass

class Account:
    def __init__(self, account_no: int, owner: str):
        self.account_no = account_no
        self.owner = owner

    def handle_event(self, event: 'DomainEvent') -> None:
        # implement your logic here to handle the domain event
        pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `@Getter` and `@Setter`. In this translation, I used Python's built-in property decorator (`@property`) for getter.
