Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class IntegrationTest:
    def __init__(self):
        self.event_processor = None

    @classmethod
    def setUp(cls):
        cls.event_processor = DomainEventProcessor()

    def test_state_recovery(self):
        self.event_processor.reset()
        
        self.event_processor.process(AccountCreateEvent(0, int(datetime.now().timestamp()), ACCOUNT_OF_DAENERYS, "Daenerys Targaryen"))
        self.event_processor.process(AccountCreateEvent(1, int(datetime.now().timestamp()), ACCOUNT_OF_JON, "Jon Snow"))

        self.event_processor.process(MoneyDepositEvent(2, int(datetime.now().timestamp()), ACCOUNT_OF_DAENERYS, Decimal("100000.00")))
        self.event_processor.process(MoneyDepositEvent(3, int(datetime.now().timestamp()), ACCOUNT_OF_JON, Decimal("100.00")))

        self.event_processor.process(MoneyTransferEvent(4, int(datetime.now().timestamp()), Decimal("10000.00"), ACCOUNT_OF_DAENERYS, ACCOUNT_OF_JON))

        account_of_daenerys_before = AccountAggregate.get_account(ACCOUNT_OF_DAENERYS)
        account_of_jon_before = AccountAggregate.get_account(ACCOUNT_OF_JON)

        AccountAggregate.reset_state()

        self.event_processor = DomainEventProcessor()
        self.event_processor.recover()

        account_of_daenerys_after = AccountAggregate.get_account(ACCOUNT_OF_DAENERYS)
        account_of_jon_after = AccountAggregate.get_account(ACCOUNT_OF_JON)

        assert account_of_daenerys_before.money == account_of_daenerys_after.money
        assert account_of_jon_before.money == account_of_jon_after.money

class DomainEventProcessor:
    def reset(self):
        pass  # Implement this method as per your requirement

    def process(self, event):
        pass  # Implement this method as per your requirement

    def recover(self):
        pass  # Implement this method as per your requirement


class AccountAggregate:
    @classmethod
    def get_account(cls, account_id):
        pass  # Implement this method as per your requirement

    @classmethod
    def reset_state(cls):
        pass  # Implement this method as per your requirement


from datetime import datetime
import decimal
```

Note: The `DomainEventProcessor`, `AccountAggregate` classes and their methods are not implemented in the given Java code. You need to implement these according to your requirements.

Also, Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's static imports or annotations like JUnit Jupiter.
