Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import os
from unittest import TestCase, main


class AppTest(TestCase):

    def test_should_execute_application_without_exception(self):
        try:
            App.main([])
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"An exception occurred: {e}")

    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        pass

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java's `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, and `@AfterEach` annotations. Instead, we use the built-in testing framework provided by Python (the `unittest` module) which provides similar functionality.

The equivalent of Java's `assertDoesNotThrow()` is a try-except block in Python where you catch any exceptions that may occur during execution of your code.
