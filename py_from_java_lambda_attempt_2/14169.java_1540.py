Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

class SergeantExtension:
    """Interface with their method."""
    
    def sergeant_ready(self):
        pass
```

Please note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we use classes to define interfaces or abstract base classes (ABCs). The `pass` statement is used as a placeholder for the method implementation since it doesn't exist yet.
