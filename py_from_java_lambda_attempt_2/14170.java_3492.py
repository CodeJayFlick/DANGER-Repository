Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

class SoldierExtension:
    """Interface with their method."""
    
    def soldier_ready(self):
        pass
```

Please note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we use classes to define abstract interfaces or protocols. The above code defines an abstract class named `SoldierExtension`, which has one abstract method (`soldier_ready`).
