Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
# The MIT License

class CoinFactory:
    """ Factory of coins """

    @staticmethod
    def get_coin(type: 'CoinType') -> 'Coin':
        return type.get_constructor().get()

class CoinType:
    pass

class Constructor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = None

    def get(self) -> 'Coin':
        # implement the logic to create a coin based on the constructor
        pass


# Example usage:
coin_type = CoinType()
constructor = Constructor()
coin_factory = CoinFactory()

try:
    coin = coin_factory.get_coin(coin_type)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the Java code, such as:

* The `Coin` class is not defined in this file, so I left it abstract.
* The `getConstructor()` method returns an instance of a `Constructor` class (which I also didn't define).
* The actual logic for creating a coin based on the constructor is missing.

You'll need to fill in these gaps and modify the code as needed to match your specific requirements.
