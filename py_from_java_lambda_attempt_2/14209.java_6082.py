Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class Sword:
    def __str__(self):
        return "Sword"
```

Note that in this Python version, we don't need to implement an interface like `Weapon` because Python doesn't have a concept similar to interfaces. Instead, you can use inheritance or composition to achieve polymorphism.
