Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
class SimpleFluentIterableTest:
    def create_fluent_iterable(self, integers):
        return SimpleFluentIterable.from_copy_of(integers)

# This part doesn't have a direct equivalent in Python as it's related to testing frameworks and isn't specific to this class.
```

Note that the Java code is using various libraries (e.g., `com.iluwatar.fluentinterface.fluentiterable.FluentIterable`, etc.) which are not present in the provided code snippet, so I couldn't translate those parts accurately.
