Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python

class Potion:
    """Interface for Potions."""

    def drink(self):
        pass


```

Please note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's interface. Instead, we use abstract classes or base classes with abstract methods to achieve similar functionality. In this case, I've used an abstract class `Potion` with one abstract method `drink`.
