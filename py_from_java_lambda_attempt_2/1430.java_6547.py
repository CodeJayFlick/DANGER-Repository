Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import ctypes

class Util:
    def __init__(self):
        self.INSTANCE = None  # Initialize with None for now.

    @staticmethod
    def openpty(amaster, aslave, name, termp, winp):
        pass  # This method needs to be implemented based on the actual functionality of 'openpty' in Linux

# Usage:
util = Util()
amaster_ref = ctypes.pointer(ctypes.c_int())
aslave_ref = ctypes.pointer(ctypes.c_int())

name_ptr = ctypes.create_string_buffer(b"")  # Assuming name is a string
termp_ptr = ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_char)()  # Assuming termp and winp are pointers to char
winp_ptr = ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_char)()

result = util.openpty(amaster_ref, aslave_ref, name_ptr, termp_ptr, winp_ptr)
```

Please note that the `openpty` method in this Python code is just a placeholder and does not actually implement any functionality. The actual implementation would depend on how you want to interface with Linux's `openpty` function from within your Python program.

Also, remember that Python doesn't have direct equivalent of Java's jnr-ffi library which provides the ability to load native libraries into JVM. However, there are some alternatives like ctypes and cffi in Python which can be used for similar purposes.
