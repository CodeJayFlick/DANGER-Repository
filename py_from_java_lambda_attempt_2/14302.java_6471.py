Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class CatapultCommand:
    def process(self):
        view = CatapultView()
        view.display()

class Command:
    pass

class CatapultView:
    def display(self):
        # Your code to display the catapult goes here
        print("Catapult View Displayed")
```

Note that I've kept the Python code as simple and straightforward as possible, without attempting to replicate any specific Java features or idioms.
