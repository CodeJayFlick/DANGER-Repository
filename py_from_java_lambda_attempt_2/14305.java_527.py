Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import logging

class ErrorView:
    def display(self):
        logging.error('Error 500')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    error_view = ErrorView()
    error_view.display()

```

Note that I did not include any external libraries or modules, as they are specific to Java and do not have direct equivalents in Python.
