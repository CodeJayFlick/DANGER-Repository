Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import io

class PtyFactory:
    """A mechanism for opening pseudo-terminals"""

    def openpty(self) -> 'Pty':
        """Open a new pseudo-terminal
        @return: A new Pty object
        @raises: IOException if an I/O error occurs, including cancellation"""
        # TO DO: implement this method in Python

    def get_description(self):
        return "A mechanism for opening pseudo-terminals"
```
Note that the `Pty` class is not defined here, as it was a Java interface and does not have a direct equivalent in Python. You would need to define your own `Pty` class or use an existing one.

Also, I used the `io` module from Python's standard library for compatibility with the original code, but you may want to consider using other libraries or modules depending on your specific needs.
