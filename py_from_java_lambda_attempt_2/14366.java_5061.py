Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "Requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app_execution(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        
        assert cm.exception.code == 0


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note: The above code is not a direct translation of the given Java code. It's an equivalent Python unit test for the `App` class, which seems to be executing some application logic without throwing any exceptions.
