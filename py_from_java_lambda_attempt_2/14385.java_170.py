Here is the translation of the Java interface `Filter` into a Python class:

```python
class Filter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.next = None
        self.last = None

    def execute(self, order: str) -> str:
        pass  # This method should be implemented by subclasses

    def set_next(self, filter: 'Filter') -> None:
        if not self.next and not self.last:
            self.next = filter
        elif self.next is None:
            self.next.set_last(filter)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cannot add a new next filter to this chain")

    def get_next(self) -> 'Filter':
        return self.next

    def set_last(self, filter: 'Filter') -> None:
        if not self.last and not self.next is None:
            self.last = filter
        elif self.last is None:
            raise ValueError("Cannot add a new last filter to this chain")
        else:
            raise ValueError("This filter has already been added as the last one")

    def get_last(self) -> 'Filter':
        return self.last
```

Note that I've used type hints for `order` and the method parameters, but Python 3.9 or later is required to use these features. If you're using an earlier version of Python, you can remove the type hints.

Also, this implementation assumes that each filter has a reference to its next filter in the chain (`self.next`) as well as its last filter in the chain (`self.last`). The `set_next` and `get_next` methods allow filters to be added or removed from the chain.
