Here is the translation of the Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class CakeBakingService:
    def bake_new_cake(self, cake_info: dict) -> None:
        """Bakes new cake according to parameters."""
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass.

    def get_all_cakes(self) -> list:
        """Get all cakes."""
        return []  # Return an empty list for now. You should implement a database query or something similar here.

    def save_new_topping(self, topping_info: dict) -> None:
        """Store new cake topping."""
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass.

    def get_available_toppings(self) -> list:
        """Get available cake toppings."""
        return []  # Return an empty list for now. You should implement a database query or something similar here.

    def save_new_layer(self, layer_info: dict) -> None:
        """Add new cake layer."""
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass.

    def get_available_layers(self) -> list:
        """Get available cake layers."""
        return []  # Return an empty list for now. You should implement a database query or something similar here.
```

Note that the `CakeInfo`, `CakeToppingInfo`, and `CakeLayerInfo` classes are not defined in this code, as they were part of the Java package you provided. In Python, these would likely be dictionaries (`dict`) or custom objects with attributes for each piece of information.

Also note that I've used type hints to indicate what types of arguments the methods expect and what types of values they return. This is not strictly necessary in Python 3.x, but it can help catch errors at runtime if you're using a linter like mypy or an IDE with static analysis capabilities.
