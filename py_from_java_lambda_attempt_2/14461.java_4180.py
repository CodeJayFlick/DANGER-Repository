Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestBullyApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.platform.startswith("java"), "This test is not compatible with JUnit")
    def test_execute_application_without_exception(self):
        try:
            BullyApp.main([])
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"An exception occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `@Test` annotation. Instead, we use the `unittest` module and define test cases using subclasses of `TestCase`. The `assertDoesNotThrow` function is also not available in Python; instead, we catch any exceptions raised by our code and fail the test if one occurs.

Also note that this translation assumes you have a separate file for your application's main method (`BullyApp.main()`), which is called from within the test.
