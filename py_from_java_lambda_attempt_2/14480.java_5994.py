Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python

class CreatureStats:
    ELF_HEALTH = 90
    ELF_DAMAGE = 40
    ORC_HEALTH = 70
    ORC_DAMAGE = 50
    HUMAN_HEALTH = 60
    HUMAN_DAMAGE = 60

# Note: Python does not have an exact equivalent of Java's enum. The above class is often used as a substitute.
```

Please note that the concept of enums in Java doesn't directly translate to Python, and we use classes or dictionaries instead.
