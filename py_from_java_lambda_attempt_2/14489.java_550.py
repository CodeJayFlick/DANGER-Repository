Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('sys.argv', [])
    def test_execute_application_without_exception(self):
        try:
            App.main([])
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Expected no exception, but got {e}")

    @unittest.skip("This is a placeholder for the run method")
    def test_execute_application_as_runnable_without_exception(self):
        try:
            app = App()
            app.run()
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Expected no exception, but got {e}")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that the `App` class and its methods (`main`, `run`) are not defined in this code. You would need to define these classes and their methods according to your specific requirements.

Also note that Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's JUnit Jupiter API, so I used the built-in unittest module instead.
