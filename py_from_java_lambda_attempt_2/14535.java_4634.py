Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "This test requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app_execution(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0
```

Note that the `App` class and its methods are not provided in your original code, so I couldn't translate them directly into Python. The above Python code is equivalent to the Java test method where it calls a main function of an `App` class without any arguments.

Also note that Python doesn't have direct equivalents for JUnit Jupiter's `@Test`, `assertDoesNotThrow`, and other annotations. Instead, you would typically use Python's built-in unit testing framework (`unittest`) to write tests.
