Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class BookService:
    def load(self) -> list:
        # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation.
        # In Python, you would typically return an empty list or query a database.
        pass

```

Note that in Python, we don't have direct equivalent of Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we define classes and methods using the same syntax as other functions. The `load` method is defined with a type hint indicating it returns a list (of unknown length).
