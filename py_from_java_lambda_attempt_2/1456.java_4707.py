Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class AbstractModelForGdbFactoryTest:
    def get_failing_factory_options(self):
        return {
            "GDB launch command": "/THIS/SHOULD/NEVER/EXIST"
        }
```

Note that in Python, we don't need to specify types for variables or method parameters. Also, the `@Override` annotation is not necessary as it's a convention used by Java and other statically-typed languages.
