Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "Requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app_execution(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that the original Java code is using JUnit Jupiter for testing, which has some specific features like `@Test` and `assertDoesNotThrow`. Python's built-in unit test framework (unittest) does not have these exact methods. Instead, we use a combination of `unittest.skipIf`, `with self.assertRaises`, and assertions to achieve similar functionality.

Also note that the original Java code is using JUnit Jupiter's `assertDoesNotThrow` method to check if calling `App.main([])` throws an exception or not. In Python, we're doing something slightly different: we're catching any exceptions raised by `App.main([])` with a context manager (`with self.assertRaises`) and then asserting that the caught exception has code 0 (which is usually what you'd expect from a successful program execution).
