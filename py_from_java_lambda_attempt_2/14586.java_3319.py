Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "This test requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Please note that the above code is not a direct translation of your Java code, but rather an equivalent Python implementation. The `App` class and its methods are assumed to be defined elsewhere in your project.

The main differences between this Python code and the original Java code are:

1. In Python, we use the built-in `unittest` module for unit testing instead of JUnit.
2. We don't need an explicit assertion library like JUnit's assertions because Python has its own assert statement.
3. The way to run a function without throwing an exception is different in Python and Java.
