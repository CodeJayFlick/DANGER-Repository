Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "Requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app_execution(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that the `App` class and its methods are not provided in your original Java code, so I couldn't translate them directly. The Python version of this test assumes a similar method signature for `App.main()` as it is in the Java code: taking an array of strings as input.

The main difference between the two codes lies in how they handle exceptions and assertions. In Java, you can use JUnit's built-in assertion methods like `assertDoesNotThrow()`. Python doesn't have a direct equivalent for this method; instead, we create our own mock using the `unittest.mock` module to test that an exception is raised when calling `App.main([])`, which should be equivalent to Java's `assertDoesNotThrow()` in terms of testing.
