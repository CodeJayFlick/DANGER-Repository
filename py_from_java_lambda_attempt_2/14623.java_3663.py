Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class Royalty:
    """Interface contracting Royalty Behaviour."""

    def make_drunk(self):
        pass

    def make_sober(self):
        pass

    def make_happy(self):
        pass

    def make_unhappy(self):
        pass
```

Note that in Python, we don't need to define an interface explicitly like you would in Java. Instead, we can simply create a class with methods that match the ones defined in the original code. The `pass` statement is used as a placeholder for now; you'll want to replace it with actual implementation logic later on.
