Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
# The MIT License

class Observer:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

class WeatherType:
    pass

class Race(Observer):
    pass
```

Please note that the translation is not a direct equivalent of Java code. Python does not have interfaces like in Java, so we are using classes instead. Also, Python's type system is different from Java's, and it doesn't support generics as they exist in Java.
