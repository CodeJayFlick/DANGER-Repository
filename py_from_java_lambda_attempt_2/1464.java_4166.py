Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AbstractModelForGdbScenarioCloneExitTest:
    def get_specimen(self):
        return "GdbLinuxSpecimen.CLONE_EXIT"

    def get_breakpoint_expression(self):
        return "work"
```

Note that this Python class does not inherit from any other classes or interfaces, unlike the Java code. Also, there is no equivalent to `@Override` in Python as it's a feature of static type checking languages like Java and C#.
