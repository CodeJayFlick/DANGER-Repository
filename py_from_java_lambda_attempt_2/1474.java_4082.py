Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

import abc

class GadpModelForGdbFactoryTest:
    def model_host(self):
        return GadpGdbModelHost()

class AbstractModelForGdbFactoryTest(abc.ABC):
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def model_host(self) -> object:
        pass

class GadpGdbModelHost:
    pass
```
Note that I've removed the Java-specific comments and replaced them with a brief summary of the Apache License, Version 2.0. The rest of the code is translated to Python using standard syntax and libraries (e.g., `abc` for abstract base classes).
