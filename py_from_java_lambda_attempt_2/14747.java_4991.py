Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class Prototype:
    def get(self, stat):
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass

    def has(self, stat):
        return False  # Default implementation: always returns False

    def set(self, stat, val):
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass

    def remove(self, stat):
        pass  # Implement this method in your subclass
```

Note that the `get`, `set`, and `remove` methods are abstract because they don't have any implementation. In Python, you would typically implement these methods in a concrete class that inherits from this interface.

Also note that there is no direct equivalent of Java's `interface` keyword in Python. Instead, we define an abstract base class (ABC) using the `abc` module or simply use a regular class with abstract methods as shown above.
