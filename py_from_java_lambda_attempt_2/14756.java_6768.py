class HeroFactory:
    """Interface for the factory class."""

    def create_mage(self):
        pass

    def create_warlord(self):
        pass

    def create_beast(self):
        pass


```

Please note that this is a direct translation of Java code into Python. The `pass` statement in each method indicates where you would put your actual implementation, but it does not do anything yet.
