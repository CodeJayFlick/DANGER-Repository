Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "This test requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app_execution(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0
```

Note: The `App` class and its `main` method are not provided in the original Java code, so I couldn't translate them directly. In Python, you would typically use a module like `sys` to handle command-line arguments and execute an application's main function.

The test case checks that calling `App.main([])` does not raise any exceptions (i.e., it runs without errors).
