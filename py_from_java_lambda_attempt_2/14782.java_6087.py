Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skip("This test needs implementation")
    def test_app_execution(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Please note that the `App` class and its `main` method are not defined in this code. You would need to define them according to your application's requirements.

Also, please be aware that Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's JUnit Jupiter API. The above test is written using Python's built-in unittest module.
