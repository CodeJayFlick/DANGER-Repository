Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "Requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0
```

Note that the `@Test` annotation is not directly translatable to Python, so I used the built-in testing framework in Python (`unittest`) and wrote a single test case. The Java code was also simplified since it seems like you were trying to run your application without any exceptions being thrown.
