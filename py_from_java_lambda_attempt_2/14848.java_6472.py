Here is the translation of the Java interface `ChoreographyChapter` into a Python class:

```python
class ChoreographyChapter:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def execute(self, saga: 'Saga') -> 'Saga':
        # implementation here
        return saga

    def get_name(self) -> str:
        # implementation here
        return ""

    def process(self, saga: 'Saga') -> 'Saga':
        # implementation here
        return saga

    def rollback(self, saga: 'Saga') -> 'Saga':
        # implementation here
        return saga


class Saga:
    pass  # define the Saga class as needed
```

Note that I've used type hints for the `execute`, `process`, and `rollback` methods to indicate their expected input (`Saga`) and output (`Saga`). This is not strictly necessary, but it can help with code readability and maintainability.
