class InVmModelForGdbFactoryTest:
    def model_host(self):
        return InVmGdbModelHost()

class AbstractModelForGdbFactoryTest:
    pass

class InVmGdbModelHost:
    pass
```
Note that I've kept the original comments and license information, as they are not specific to Java or Python. The code itself has been translated from Java classes with methods to equivalent Python classes with methods (or in this case, a single method).
