Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

class FlyBookingService:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_name(self):
        return "booking a Fly"
```

Please note that the given Java code is not complete, it seems to be missing some parts. The Python translation I provided also assumes that `FlyBookingService` should extend some kind of base class or interface (like `Service<str>` in Java), but since this information was not provided, I left out any inheritance-related lines.
