Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "Requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app(self):
        with patch('sys.argv', ['']):
            assert not App().main([])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that the `App` class and its `main` method are assumed to be defined elsewhere in your Python code. The equivalent of Java's JUnit is Python's built-in `unittest` module, which provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests.

The test case uses the `patch` function from the `mock` module to mock out the `sys.argv` list that would normally be passed as an argument to the `App.main()` method. This allows us to simulate the main() method being called without actually executing it, which is useful for testing purposes.
