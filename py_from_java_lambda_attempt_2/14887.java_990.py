Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "This test requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app_execution(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0
```

Please note that the above code is not a direct translation of your Java code but rather an equivalent unit test for the `App` class in Python. The main difference between this and your original Java code is that it uses Python's built-in unittest module to write tests, whereas you were using JUnit Jupiter API.

Also, please note that there are some differences in how exceptions work in Python compared to Java. In particular, when running a script from the command line (like `App.main([])`), Python will raise a SystemExit exception if the main function returns without calling sys.exit().
