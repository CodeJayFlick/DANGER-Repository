Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
# The MIT License

class ServiceLocator:
    _services = {}

    @classmethod
    def get_service(cls, service_name):
        if service_name not in cls._services:
            # TO DO: implement logic to retrieve the service from JNDI or other source
            pass
        return cls._services[service_name]

def main():
    SERVICE_A = "jndi/serviceA"
    SERVICE_B = "jndi/serviceB"

    for _ in range(4):
        service = ServiceLocator.get_service(SERVICE_A)
        if service:
            service.execute()
        else:
            print("Service not found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Please note that the Java code uses a `package` declaration and imports, which are not necessary in Python. Also, I've replaced the static variables with constants defined at the top of the file for better readability. The logic to retrieve services from JNDI or other source is left as TO DO comment since it's specific to your application.
