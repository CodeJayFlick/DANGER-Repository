Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "Requires Python 3.7 or higher")
    def test_app(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0
```

Note that the original Java code is a JUnit test for an application (`App`) and uses assertions to verify that calling `main` without arguments does not throw any exceptions. The Python version also tests this behavior, but it's done in a different way due to differences between Java and Python.

In particular:

- In Java, you can use the `@Test` annotation on methods to mark them as test methods.
- In Python, you need to subclass `unittest.TestCase` and define your own test method using the same name (e.g., `test_app`) but without any special annotations.
- The original code uses JUnit's `assertDoesNotThrow` assertion. This is not available in Python's unittest framework. Instead, we use a try-except block to catch exceptions raised by calling `App.main([])`.
- In Java, you can directly call the `main` method with an array of strings as its argument. In Python, this would raise a `SystemExit` exception if the program terminates normally (i.e., without raising any other exceptions). We use a try-except block to catch and verify that this is what happens.
- The original code uses JUnit's `assertDoesNotThrow`. This assertion checks whether calling a given function does not throw an exception. In Python, we don't have such a built-in assertion; instead, we manually check the result of our test method.

Please note that you would need to replace `App` with your actual application class and ensure it has a `main` method that can be called without arguments in order for this code to work correctly.
