Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```
class ApplicationServices:
    def logged_in_user_purchase(self, user_name: str, item_name: str) -> 'ReceiptViewModel':
        pass
```

Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we define an abstract base class (ABC) using the `class` keyword with no implementation for any methods.

The method signature is translated as follows:

* The return type of the method (`ReceiptViewModel`) is kept unchanged.
* The parameter types (`String`, `String`) are replaced with Python's built-in string type (`str`).
