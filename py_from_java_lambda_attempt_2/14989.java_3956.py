Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
class Goblin:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__init__("Goblin", "small", "walking", "green", 30.0)

    def __init__(self, mass: float):
        super().__init__("Goblin", "small", "walking", "green", mass)
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `package` statement or the MIT License comment block at the top of the file. The code above is written in pure Python and does not include any external imports or references to other classes or modules.
