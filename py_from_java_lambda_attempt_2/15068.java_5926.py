Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import logging

class SubtleMethod:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    def pick_target(self) -> str:
        return "shop keeper"

    def confuse_target(self, target: str) -> None:
        self.logger.info("Approach the {} with tears running and hug him!", target)

    def steal_the_item(self, target: str) -> None:
        self.logger.info("While in close contact grab the {}'s wallet.", target)
```
Note that I've used Python's built-in `logging` module to implement logging similar to Java's SLF4J. The rest of the code is straightforward translation from Java to Python, using equivalent syntax and data types where possible.

Also, please keep in mind that this code may not be exactly equivalent to the original Java code, as some details like package names or exact method signatures might have been lost during translation.
