Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
class HitAndRunMethodTest:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            HitAndRunMethod(),
            "old goblin woman",
            "The target has been chosen as old goblin woman.",
            "Approach the old goblin woman from behind.",
            "Grab the handbag and run away fast!"
        )
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `package` statement, so I omitted it. Also, in Python, we don't need to specify types for method parameters or return values like we do in Java.
