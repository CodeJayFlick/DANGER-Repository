Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import os
import unittest

class AppTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_execute_without_exception(self):
        try:
            import app  # Assuming your application file name is 'app.py'
            app.main([])
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"An exception occurred: {e}")

    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        for filename in ["fish1.out", "fish2.out"]:
            if os.path.exists(filename):
                os.remove(filename)

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java's `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, and `@AfterEach` annotations. Instead, we use the `unittest` framework with its built-in support for test cases and setup/teardown methods.

In this code:

- The `AppTest` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
- The `test_execute_without_exception` method is a test case that tries to execute your application's main function without any arguments. If an exception occurs, the test fails.
- The `setUpClass` and `tearDownClass` methods are used for setup and teardown operations at the class level. In this example, we use them to delete files named "fish1.out" and "fish2.out".
