Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import time
import threading

class BallItem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.twin = None

    def set_twin(self, twin):
        self.twin = twin

    def click(self):
        print("Ball item clicked")

    def stop_me(self):
        pass  # no equivalent in Python


class BallThread(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.twin = None
        self.stop_request = False

    def set_twin(self, twin):
        self.twin = twin

    def run(self):
        while not self.stop_request:
            time.sleep(0.75)  # equivalent to waiting()
            if self.twin is not None and hasattr(self.twin, 'click'):
                self.twin.click()

    def stop_me(self):
        self.stop_request = True


def main():
    ball_item = BallItem()
    ball_thread = BallThread()

    ball_item.set_twin(ball_thread)
    ball_thread.set_twin(ball_item)

    ball_thread.start()

    time.sleep(0.75)  # equivalent to waiting()

    ball_item.click()

    time.sleep(0.75)  # equivalent to waiting()

    ball_item.click()

    time.sleep(0.75)  # equivalent to waiting()

    ball_thread.stop_me()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Note that I had to make some changes to the code, such as:

* In Python, we don't need a `throws Exception` clause in method signatures.
* The `waiting()` function is replaced with `time.sleep(0.75)`, which achieves the same effect.
* The `stopMe()` method in Java has no direct equivalent in Python, so I left it as-is (it's not actually doing anything useful).
* In Python, we use the `threading` module to create threads, and the `run()` method is used instead of `start()`.
* The `main()` function is defined explicitly, with a guard clause (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) to ensure it's only executed when run as a script.
