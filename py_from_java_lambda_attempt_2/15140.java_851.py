Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
class StudentDatabase:
    def insert(self, student):
        # Some insert logic here (e.g., database connection)
        pass

    def modify(self, student):
        # Some modify logic here (e.g., database query)
        pass

    def delete(self, student):
        # Some delete logic here (e.g., database deletion)
        pass
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `package` statement. In Python, you would typically put your classes in separate files or modules, and then import them as needed.

Also note that the comments (`//Some insert logic to DB`, etc.) are just placeholders for actual database operations. You would need to replace these with real code to interact with a database (e.g., using a library like `sqlite3` or `pandas`).
