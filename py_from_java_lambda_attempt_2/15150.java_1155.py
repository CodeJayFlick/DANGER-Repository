Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skipIf(sys.version_info < (3, 7), "Jupiter API not available in this version")
    def test_app_execution(self):
        with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:
            App.main([])
        assert cm.exception.code == 0
```

Note that the Python code is very different from the Java code. This is because Python and Java are two distinct programming languages, each with its own syntax, semantics, and idioms.

Here's a brief explanation of what I did:

1. In Python, we don't need to declare classes or methods like in Java.
2. The `unittest` module provides functionality for writing unit tests, which is similar to JUnit in Java.
3. Instead of using the `@Test` annotation from JUnit, we define a test method with the same name (`test_app_execution`) and use the `unittest.skipIf` decorator to skip this test if the Python version is less than 3.7 (since Jupiter API requires at least Python 3.7).
4. In the test method itself, I used the `with self.assertRaises(SystemExit) as cm:` context manager to catch any exceptions raised by calling `App.main([])` and assert that it's a SystemExit exception with code 0.

Please note that this is just one possible way to translate Java code to Python; there are many other ways to do so, depending on the specific requirements of your project.
