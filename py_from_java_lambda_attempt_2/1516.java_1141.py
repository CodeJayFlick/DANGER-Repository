Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DebugClientReentrant:
    def create_client(self):
        # Implementation for this method goes here.
        pass

    def get_listener(self):
        # Implementation for this method goes here.
        return None  # Replace with actual implementation.

# You can use it like this:
reentrant = DebugClientReentrant()
new_client = reentrant.create_client()
listener = reentrant.get_listener()

```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface concept. Instead, we define a class `DebugClientReentrant` and implement the methods as per our requirement.

Also, in Python, there is no need to explicitly declare return types for functions like you do in Java. The function will automatically return None if nothing else is specified.
