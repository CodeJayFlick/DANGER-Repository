Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class CommanderVisitorTest:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            CommanderVisitor(),
            "Good to see you commander",
            None,
            None
        )

# Note: The above class does not have any methods or attributes other than its constructor.
```

This is because the provided Java code only contains a test class with a single constructor, and no actual visitor logic.
