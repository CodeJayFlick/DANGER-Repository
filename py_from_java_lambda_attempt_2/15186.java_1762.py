Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python code:

```Python
from typing import List, Set, Dict

class AddressBookEntry:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # Initialize with default values or add constructor if needed


class AddressBookDao:
    @staticmethod
    def insert_or_update(address_book_entry: AddressBookEntry) -> None:
        """Inserts or updates an address book entry"""
        pass  # Implement the logic to handle inserts and updates

    @staticmethod
    def delete_by_address(address: str) -> None:
        """Deletes a record from the address book by its address"""
        pass  # Implement the logic for deletion

    @staticmethod
    def resolve_label(address: str) -> str:
        """Resolves the label associated with an address in the address book"""
        return "Label"  # Replace this placeholder with actual implementation

    @staticmethod
    def get_entries_by_constraint(constraint: str) -> List[AddressBookEntry]:
        """Gets all entries from the address book that match a given constraint"""
        pass  # Implement the logic for searching and returning results

    @staticmethod
    def get_all_entries() -> Dict:
        """Returns all entries in the address book, sorted by label"""
        return {"entries": []}  # Replace this placeholder with actual implementation

    @staticmethod
    def get_entries_except(except: Set[str]) -> Dict:
        """Gets all entries from the address book except those that match a given set of addresses"""
        pass  # Implement the logic for searching and returning results


# Example usage:

address_book_entry = AddressBookEntry()
AddressBookDao.insert_or_update(address_book_entry)

AddressBookDao.delete_by_address("some-address")

label = AddressBookDao.resolve_label("another-address")
print(label)  # Output: Label

entries = AddressBookDao.get_entries_by_constraint("%constraint%")
for entry in entries:
    print(entry.label, entry.address)
```

Please note that this is a translation of the Java code into Python and may not be an exact equivalent. The actual implementation will depend on your specific requirements and database schema.
