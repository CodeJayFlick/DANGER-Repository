    def __init__(self):
        if not hasattr(self, 'initialized'):
            self.initialized = True
            # Initialize the database here.

    def exchange_rate_dao(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Must be implemented by subclass.")
```

Please note that this is a simplified translation. The original Java code uses Room persistence library which provides more functionality like data migration, schema management and so on. Python's sqlite3 module does not provide these features out of the box.
