Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python code:

```Python
# Copyright (C) 2021 Andreas Schildbach

import logging

class RestoreWalletFromExternalActivity:
    def __init__(self):
        self.log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    def on_create(self, savedInstanceState: dict):
        super().on_create(savedInstanceState)
        self.log.info("Referrer: %s", get_referrer())
        from_restore_wallet_dialog_fragment.show(getSupportFragmentManager(), getIntent().getData())

# Define the AbstractWalletActivity class
class AbstractWalletActivity:
    pass

def get_referrer():
    # Implement this method to return referrer information
    pass

def getSupportFragmentManager():
    # Implement this method to return a support fragment manager
    pass

def getIntent():
    # Implement this method to return an intent
    pass

from_restore_wallet_dialog_fragment = None  # Define the RestoreWalletDialogFragment class
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java classes like `LoggerFactory` and Android-specific components. This translation is a simplified representation of the original code, focusing on equivalent logic in Python.

The following are some key differences between this Python version and the original Java code:

1.  **Java's package structure**: In Python, there isn't an exact equivalent to Java packages. Instead, you can use modules or classes with descriptive names.
2.  **Android-specific components**: Since Python is not designed for Android development like Java is, we've omitted these parts and left them as placeholders (`getSupportFragmentManager`, `getIntent`).
3.  **LoggerFactory**: In Python, logging is handled using the built-in `logging` module or third-party libraries.
4.  **Method overriding**: Python doesn't support method overriding in the same way Java does. Instead, you can define a new method with the desired behavior.

This translation should give you an idea of how to approach similar logic in Python, but it's not meant as a direct replacement for the original code.
