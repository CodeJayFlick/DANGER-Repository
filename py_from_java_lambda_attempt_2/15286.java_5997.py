Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class SendCoinsActivityViewModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.show_help_dialog = None  # equivalent to MutableLiveData in Java

# Note: The following copyright notice is not translated as it's a separate entity from the class definition.
```

In this translation, I've kept the `show_help_dialog` attribute but made it an instance variable by defining it within the constructor (`__init__`). This is because Python doesn't have direct equivalent of Java's MutableLiveData.
