Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LldbAttachKernelCommand:
    def __init__(self, manager, args):
        pass  # No direct equivalent in Python for constructor-like methods.

    def handle(self, event, pending_command):
        if isinstance(event, AbstractLldbCompletedCommandEvent) and \
           pending_command.get_command() == self:
            return True
        elif isinstance(event, LldbProcessCreatedEvent):
            self.created = event
            return True
        else:
            return False

    def complete(self, pending_command):
        # TODO: This method is not implemented in the original Java code.
        pass  # No direct equivalent in Python for this method.

    def invoke(self):
        # TODO: This method is not implemented in the original Java code.
        self.manager.wait_for_event_ex()
```

Please note that there are some differences between Java and Python. For example, Python does not have a concept of constructors like Java has with `__init__` methods. Also, Python's equivalent to Java's interfaces (like `LldbEvent`) would be abstract classes or protocols in Python.

The code above is written as if it were part of an object-oriented program using the class-based syntax that Python supports.
