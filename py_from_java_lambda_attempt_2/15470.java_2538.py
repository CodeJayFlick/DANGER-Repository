And here's how you would translate a Java package declaration into Python:

```python
import ai.djl.modality.nlp.embedding  # This is equivalent to importing all classes in this package
from ai.djl.modality.nlp.embedding import *  # This imports everything from this package, similar to the "wildcard" import in Java
```

Please note that these are not actual Python code but rather a translation of comments and declarations.
