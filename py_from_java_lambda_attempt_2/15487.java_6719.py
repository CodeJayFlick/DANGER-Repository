Here's the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class TextProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def preprocess(self, tokens: list) -> list:
        """
        Applies preprocessing defined by this processor to the given input tokens.

        Args:
            tokens (list): The tokens created after the input text is tokenized

        Returns:
            list: The preprocessed tokens
        """
        # TO DO: implement your preprocessing logic here
        return tokens
```

Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's interface. Instead, we can use abstract classes or protocols (in some frameworks) to define the contract for subclasses. In this case, I've used an abstract class (`TextProcessor`) with one method (`preprocess`).
