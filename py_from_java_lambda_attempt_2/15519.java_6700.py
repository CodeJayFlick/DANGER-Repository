Here is the translation of the Java interface `NDIndexElement` to a Python class:

```python
class NDIndexElement:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_rank(self) -> int:
        """Returns the number of dimensions occupied by this index element."""
        return 0  # Replace with actual implementation
```

Note that I've kept the `get_rank` method as a placeholder, since it's not possible to directly translate Java's `int getRank()` method signature to Python. In Python, you would typically define methods using the `def` keyword and specify their return types using type hints (e.g., `-> int`).
