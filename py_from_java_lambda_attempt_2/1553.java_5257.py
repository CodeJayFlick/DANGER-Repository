Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LldbListBreakpointsCommand:
    def __init__(self, manager, session):
        self.manager = manager
        self.session = session
        self.updated_breakpoints = {}

    def complete(self, pending=None):
        breakpoints = self.manager.get_known_breakpoints(self.session)
        for id in list(breakpoints.keys()):
            if id in self.updated_breakpoints:
                continue  # Do nothing, we're in sync
            self.manager.add_breakpoint_if_absent(self.session, self.updated_breakpoints.pop(id))
        for id in list(breakpoints.keys()):
            if id not in self.updated_breakpoints and id in breakpoints:
                self.manager.remove_breakpoint(self.session, id)
        return self.manager.get_known_breakpoints(self.session)

    def invoke(self):
        self.updated_breakpoints.clear()
        num_breakpoints = self.session.GetNumBreakpoints()
        for i in range(num_breakpoints):
            breakpoint = self.session.GetBreakpointAtIndex(i)
            self.updated_breakpoints[DebugClient().get_id(breakpoint)] = breakpoint
        num_watchpoints = self.session.GetNumWatchpoints()
        for i in range(num_watchpoints):
            watchpoint = self.session.GetWatchpointAtIndex(i)
            self.updated_breakpoints[DebugClient().get_id(watchpoint)] = watchpoint

class DebugClient:
    @staticmethod
    def get_id(breakpoint_or_watchpoint):
        # This method should return the ID of a breakpoint or watchpoint.
        pass  # Replace this with actual implementation.

# Example usage:

manager = LldbManagerImpl()  # Assuming you have an equivalent class in Python
session = SBTarget()
command = LldbListBreakpointsCommand(manager, session)
command.invoke()

pending_command = None  # You might need to create a pending command depending on your use case.
result = command.complete(pending_command)

```

Please note that this translation is not exact and some parts of the code may be missing or modified. The original Java code seems to have dependencies on other classes, such as `LldbManagerImpl`, `SBTarget`, and `DebugClient`. These are likely equivalent Python classes which you would need to implement separately.

Also, there might be differences in how certain methods work between Java and Python due to the different nature of these languages.
