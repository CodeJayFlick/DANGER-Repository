Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LldbListStackFrameRegisterBanksCommand:
    def __init__(self, manager, frame):
        self.manager = manager
        self.frame = frame
        self.result = {}

    def complete(self, pending=None):
        return self.result

    def invoke(self):
        self.result = {}
        registers = self.frame.get_registers()
        n = len(registers)
        for i in range(n):
            bank = registers[i]
            self.result[DebugClient.id(bank)] = bank


class DebugClient:
    @staticmethod
    def id(value):
        return str(value)


# Example usage:
manager = None  # Replace with your LldbManagerImpl instance
frame = None  # Replace with your SBFrame instance

command = LldbListStackFrameRegisterBanksCommand(manager, frame)
print(command.complete(None))  # Print the result of invoking the command
```

Please note that this translation is not a direct conversion from Java to Python. The original code seems to be part of an LLDB (Low-Level Debugger) framework and uses specific classes like `SBFrame`, `LldbManagerImpl`, etc., which are not available in standard Python libraries. Therefore, I had to create equivalent classes (`DebugClient` and `LldbListStackFrameRegisterBanksCommand`) that mimic the behavior of these Java classes.

The above code assumes you have a way to get an instance of `SBFrame` (which represents a stack frame) and `LldbManagerImpl` (the manager for LLDB). The actual implementation would depend on how you are using LLDB in your Python application.
