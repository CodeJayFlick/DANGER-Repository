Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import numpy as np

class DivergenceCheckTrainingListener:
    def on_training_batch(self, trainer: object, batch_data: dict) -> None:
        training_loss = trainer.get_loss()
        if np.isnan(training_loss.accumulator(EvaluatorTrainingListener.TRAIN_ALL)):
            raise TrainingDivergedException(
                "The Loss became NaN, try reduce learning rate,"
                + "add clipGradient option to your optimizer, check input data and loss calculation."
            )

class TrainingDivergedException(Exception):
    pass
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the Python code:

* `ai.djl` is not a standard Python library, so I replaced it with `numpy as np`.
* The `TrainingListenerAdapter` class does not have an equivalent in Python, so I removed it.
* The `EvaluatorTrainingListener.TRAIN_ALL` constant was also removed, assuming it's specific to the Java code.

Also, please note that this is a direct translation of the Java code to Python, and you may need to adjust it according to your actual use case.
