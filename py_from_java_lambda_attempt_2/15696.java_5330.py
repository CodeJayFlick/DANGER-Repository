I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language-specific file, but rather a license notice and package declaration in Java.

Since you asked me to "translate" it to Python, I'll assume you want me to provide equivalent information in Python. Here's what I came up with:

```

# OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. See the License for the specific language governing permissions
# and limitations under the License.
```

And here's a Python package declaration:

```python
from __future__ import absolute_import

__author__ = 'Your Name'
__version__ = '1.0'

import pkg_resources

try:
    _distributions = {'ai.djl.training.loss': str(pkg_resources.get_distribution('ai.djl.training.loss'))}
except pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound:
    pass
```

Please note that this is not a direct translation, but rather equivalent information in Python format.
