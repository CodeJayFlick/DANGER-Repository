Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class NoopTranslator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.batchifier = None

    def set_batchifier(self, batchifier):
        self.batchifier = batchifier


def process_input(ctx, input_list):
    return input_list


def process_output(ctx, output_list):
    return output_list


class TranslatorContext:
    pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `package`, `import`, and `@Override` statements. The equivalent of a Java class is simply defined using the `class` keyword in Python.

The `TranslatorContext` class was left unchanged as it seems to be an abstract concept used by other parts of your code, but its actual implementation would depend on how you choose to use it.

Also note that there are no direct equivalents for Java's `NDList`, `Batchifier`, and `Translator`. These seem to be custom classes or interfaces specific to the AI/ML domain.
