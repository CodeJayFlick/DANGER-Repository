Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class PreProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def process_input(self, ctx: any, input: any) -> list:
        """
        Processes the input and converts it to NDList.

        Args:
            ctx (any): The toolkit for creating the input NDArray.
            input (any): The input object.

        Returns:
            list: The processed input as a list of NDArrays.

        Raises:
            Exception: If an error occurs during processing the input.
        """
        # Your implementation here
        pass

```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent to Java's generics, so I used `any` type for parameters. Also, Python doesn't support checked exceptions like Java, but you can use built-in exception types or raise a custom one if needed.
