Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class ServingTranslator:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def set_arguments(self, arguments: dict) -> None:
        """
        Sets the configurations for the Translator instance.

        Args:
            arguments (dict): The configurations for the Translator instance.
        """
        # Your code to handle the configuration goes here
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's interface. Instead, we define a class with methods that are meant to be implemented by any subclass. In this case, `ServingTranslator` is an abstract base class (ABC) because it has no implementation for its method and only provides the signature for others to follow.

Also note that Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's generics system. Instead, we use type hints like `(dict)` in the function definition to indicate what types are expected as arguments or returned by the function.
