Here is the translation of the given Java interface into equivalent Python:

```Python
class JsonSerializable:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def to_json(self) -> str:
        """Returns a json presentation of the object."""
        # Implement your logic here to convert this object into JSON string.
        return ""
```

Note that in Python, we don't have direct equivalent for Java's interface concept. We use abstract base classes (ABCs) or interfaces from third-party libraries like `typing` module if needed.

Also note that the `BytesSupplier` and `Serializable` concepts are not directly translatable to Python as they rely on specific features of Java such as streams, lambda functions etc., which do not have direct equivalent in Python.
