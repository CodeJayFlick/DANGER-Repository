Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import numpy as np
from io import BytesIO

class NDListTest:
    def test_numpy(self):
        try:
            data = self.read_file("list.npz")
            decoded_list = self.decode(data)

            bos = BytesIO()
            decoded_list.encode(bos, True)
            list_ = self.decode(bos.getvalue())
            assert len(list_) == 2
            assert list_[0].name == "bool8"
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

    def read_file(self, filename):
        # Implement your file reading logic here
        pass

    def decode(self, data):
        # Implement your decoding logic here
        return np.load(BytesIO(data), allow_pickle=True)

# Usage example
test = NDListTest()
test.test_numpy()
```

Please note that the `read_file` and `decode` methods are placeholders for actual implementation. You would need to implement these based on your specific requirements.

Also, Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's try-with-resources statement. Instead, you can use a try-except block with a finally clause if needed.
