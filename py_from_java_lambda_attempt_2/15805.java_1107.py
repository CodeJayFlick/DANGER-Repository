I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language-specific file, but rather a copyright notice, license information, and package declaration for Java.

Since you asked me to "translate" it to Python, I'll assume you want me to provide equivalent Python constructs. Here's what I came up with:

```

```

And:

```
import ai_djl_training  # assuming 'ai_djl_training' is a Python package

__package__ = "ai.djl.training"
```

Please note that these are not actual tests or code, but rather equivalent declarations in Python. If you're looking for help translating Java-specific constructs (e.g., classes, methods) to Python, I'd be happy to assist with those as well!
