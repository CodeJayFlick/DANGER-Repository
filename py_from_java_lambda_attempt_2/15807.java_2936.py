I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language instruction or statement, but rather:

1. A copyright notice: This indicates who owns the intellectual property rights of the software.
2. Licensing information: This explains how others can use the software and what restrictions apply.

As such, there is no Python translation needed for this code.
