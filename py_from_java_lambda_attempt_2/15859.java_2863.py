Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```python
import torch
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

class FashionMnistTest:
    def test_fashion_mnist_remote(self):
        # Define training config
        loss_fn = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
        config = {
            'loss': loss_fn,
            # Add more configuration options as needed
        }

        try:
            model = torch.jit.script(torch.nn.Identity())
            manager = torch.ndmanager()

            fashion_mnist = datasets.FashionMNIST(
                root='./data',
                train=True,
                download=True,
                transform=transforms.ToTensor(),
                target_transform=torch.tensor([]),
                usage='test'
            )

            trainer = model.train(config)

            batch = next(trainer.iterate_dataset(fashion_mnist))
            assert len(batch.data) == 1
            assert len(batch.labels) == 1

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
```
Note that I've used the `torch` and `torchvision` libraries to translate the code, since they are equivalent to the Java libraries used in the original code. Additionally, I've replaced the Java-specific constructs (such as annotations and try-with-resources statements) with Pythonic equivalents.

Also, please note that this is a translation of the provided Java code into Python, but it may not be exactly what you would write if starting from scratch in Python.
