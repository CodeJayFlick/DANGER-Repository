Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DLRLibrary:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def get_dlr_num_inputs(handle):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        return 0

    @staticmethod
    def get_dlr_num_weights(handle):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        return 0

    @staticmethod
    def get_dlr_input_name(handle, index):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        return ""

    @staticmethod
    def get_dlr_weight_name(handle, index):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        return ""

    @staticmethod
    def set_dlr_input(handle, name, shape, input, dim):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def get_dlr_output_shape(handle, index):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        return []

    @staticmethod
    def get_dlr_output(handle, index):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        return []

    @staticmethod
    def get_dlr_num_outputs(handle):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        return 0

    @staticmethod
    def create_dlr_model(model_path, device_type, device_id):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def delete_dlr_model(handle):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def run_dlr_model(handle):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def get_dlr_backend(handle):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        return ""

    @staticmethod
    def get_dlr_version():
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        return ""

    @staticmethod
    def set_dlr_num_threads(handle, threads):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        pass

    @staticmethod
    def use_dlr_cpu_affinity(handle, use):
        # This method should be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
        pass


# Initialize the DLRLibrary singleton instance
dlr_library = DLRLibrary()
```

Please note that this Python translation is not a direct equivalent of the Java code. The methods in the `DlrLibrary` class are static and do not have any implementation, as they would typically be implemented using ctypes or another library to call native C++ code.
