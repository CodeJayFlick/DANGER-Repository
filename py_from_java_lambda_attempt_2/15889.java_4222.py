I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language or instructions that can be translated into another language like Python.

The first part appears to be copyright information and licensing terms for an open-source project. The second part seems to be package declaration and comments in Java (not Python).

Here's what you might expect if this were actual Python code:

```
# Copyright 2020 Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates. All Rights Reserved.

#

import ai.djl dlrengine

class DLRInterface:
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("This is a Python program using AI.DJL library")
```

Please note that this code doesn't actually translate or implement any of the original Java code, as it's not possible to directly convert package declarations and comments into another programming language.
