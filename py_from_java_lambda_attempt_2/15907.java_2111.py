I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language instruction or statement, but rather:

1. A copyright notice: This indicates who owns the intellectual property rights of the software.
2. Licensing information: This explains how the software can be used and distributed.

As such, there is no Python translation needed for this code. The original code appears to be written in Java (based on the package name `ml.dmlc.xgboost4j.java`), which cannot be translated directly into Python.

If you're looking for a similar copyright notice or licensing information in Python, I can provide that!
