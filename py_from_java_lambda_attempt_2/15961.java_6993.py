I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language instruction or algorithm, but rather:

1. A copyright notice: This indicates who owns the intellectual property rights of the software.
2. A license statement: This explains under what terms you can use the software.

As such, there is no Python translation to be done here. The code appears to be written in Java (based on the package names and syntax), but since it's not actual programming instructions or algorithms, I won't translate anything.
