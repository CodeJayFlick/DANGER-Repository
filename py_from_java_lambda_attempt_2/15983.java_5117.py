Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python code:

```Python
class PaddlePredictor:
    def __init__(self, handle):
        self.handle = handle

    def copy(self):
        return PaddlePredictor(JniUtils.clone_predictor(self))

    def close(self):
        JniUtils.delete_predictor(self)
```

Note that this translation is not a direct equivalent of the Java code. Python does not have built-in support for native resources or JNI (Java Native Interface) like Java does, so we've omitted those parts and focused on translating the logic into Python.

Also note that `JniUtils` in the original Java code seems to be related to interacting with C++ code using JNI. In this translation, I've simply replaced it with a hypothetical equivalent function or class (`JniUtils`) for demonstration purposes only.
