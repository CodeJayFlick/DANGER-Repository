Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LldbExceptionEvent:
    def __init__(self, info):
        self.info = info


# This part doesn't have a direct equivalent in Python as it's related to package structure which varies between languages.
```

Note that this Python class `LldbExceptionEvent` does not inherit from any parent class (like Java's `AbstractLldbEvent`) and the constructor (`__init__`) takes one argument, `info`, of type `DebugProcessInfo`.
