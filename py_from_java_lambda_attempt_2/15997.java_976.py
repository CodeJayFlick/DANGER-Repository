I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language instruction or statement in any form. It appears to be:

1. A copyright notice: This section informs about the ownership of the intellectual property rights.
2. Licensing information: The Apache License 2.0 terms and conditions are mentioned.

There's no actual Python code to translate, as this text is not a programming language instruction or statement.
