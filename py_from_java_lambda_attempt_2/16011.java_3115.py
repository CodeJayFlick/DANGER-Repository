Here is the translation of the given Java-like comments into pure Python:

And here's how you could translate the Java package declaration into Python:

```python
import ai.djl.paddlepaddle.zoo as PpModelZoo

class Zoo:
    pass  # This is equivalent to a class in Java, but it does nothing.
```

Please note that this translation assumes that `ai.djl. paddlepaddle.zoo` is an existing Python package or module.
