Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LldbModuleUnloadedEvent:
    def __init__(self, info):
        super().__init__(info)
```

Note that this is a simplified version as it does not include all the details present in the original Java code. The `AbstractLldbEvent` class and its methods are not included here because they do not have direct Python equivalents.

Also note that Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) syntax differs from Java's, so some constructs like classes, inheritance, constructors etc., may look different but serve similar purposes.
