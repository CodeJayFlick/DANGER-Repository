Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import os

class LibUtilsTest:
    def setup(self):
        os.environ['ai.djl.pytorch.native_helper'] = 'ai.djl.pytorch.integration.LibUtilsTest'

    def teardown(self):
        if 'ai.djl.pytorch.native_helper' in os.environ:
            del os.environ['ai.djl.pytorch.native_helper']

    def test(self):
        from ai_djl import Engine
        Engine.getInstance()

    @staticmethod
    def load(path):
        pass  # NOPMD equivalent, does nothing

# Usage example:
test = LibUtilsTest()
test.setup()
test.test()  # This will call the setup and then run the test method.
test.teardown()  # After running the test, this will remove the environment variable.
```

Please note that Python doesn't have direct equivalents for Java's `@BeforeClass`, `@AfterClass` annotations. Instead, you would typically define these methods as part of your class definition and call them manually before/after executing specific parts of your code.

Also, there is no equivalent to Java's `System.load(path)` method in Python. The `load()` function provided above does nothing (NOPMD), but if you want to load a module or package in Python, you would use the `import` statement followed by the name of the module/package.
