I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language-specific file, but rather a copyright notice and package declaration for Java.

Here's why:

* The `/*` and `*/` symbols are used in many languages as comment delimiters.
* The `package ai.djl.tensorflow.engine;` line declares a Java package name. This syntax is specific to the Java programming language.

Since you didn't provide any actual code, I can only translate the copyright notice and package declaration into Python:

```

As you can see, there's no actual code to translate from Java to Python!
