Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class Delegate:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_native_handle(self) -> int:
        """Returns a native handle to the TensorFlow Lite delegate implementation."""
        return 0  # Replace with actual logic for getting the native handle.
```

Note that this translation does not include any copyright or license information, as these are typically included in separate files (e.g., `LICENSE.txt`) rather than within code itself.
