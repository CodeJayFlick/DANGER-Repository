Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LldbStructuredDataEvent:
    def __init__(self, info):
        super().__init__(info)
```

Note that this Python class does not have any direct equivalent to Java's `extends AbstractLldbEvent<DebugProcessInfo>` declaration. In Python, classes are defined using the `class` keyword and do not require explicit inheritance declarations.

Also note that there is no need for a separate package definition in Python as it is handled by the module system.
