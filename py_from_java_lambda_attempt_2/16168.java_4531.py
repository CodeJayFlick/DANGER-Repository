Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import unittest

class BertQaTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_bert_qa(self):
        try:
            result = BertQaInference.predict()
            self.assertEqual(result, "[december, 2004]")
        except Exception as e:
            raise AssertionError(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
Note that I've replaced the Java-specific constructs with Python equivalents:

* The `package` declaration is not needed in Python.
* The imports are simplified to use Python's built-in modules and libraries.
* The `public class BertQaTest { ... }` syntax is replaced with a Python class definition using the `class` keyword.
* The `@Test` annotation is replaced with a test method decorated with the `unittest.TestCase` framework.
* The Java-specific exceptions are replaced with Python's built-in `Exception` type, and the error handling is simplified to use Python's `try`-`except` block.

Also note that I've assumed that there is a separate module or class called `BertQaInference` containing the `predict()` method. If this is not the case, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
