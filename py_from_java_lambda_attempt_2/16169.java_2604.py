Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
import unittest
from PIL import Image

class BigGANTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_biggan(self):
        try:
            generated_images = BigGAN.generate()
            if generated_images is None:
                raise self.skipTest("Only works for PyTorch engine.")
            self.assertEqual(len(generated_images), 5)
            for img in generated_images:
                self.assertEqual(img.width, 256)
                self.assertEqual(img.height, 256)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that this code is not a direct translation of the Java code. It's more like an equivalent Python implementation with some differences in syntax and semantics between the two languages.

- The `@Test` annotation from Java has been replaced by the `test_biggan` method definition.
- The `Assert.assertEquals` methods have been replaced by the built-in `assertEqual` method of the `unittest.TestCase` class.
- The `SkipException` has been replaced with a call to the `skipTest` method, which is part of the `unittest.TestCase` class.
- The `Image[] generatedImages = BigGAN.generate();` line has been translated into Python as `generated_images = BigGAN.generate()`.
- The Java code's try-catch block for handling exceptions has been replaced with a single try-except block in Python.
