Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LldbSymbolsLoadedEvent:
    def __init__(self, info):
        self.info = info


# Note: In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's abstract classes.
# We can use inheritance and polymorphism instead. For example,
class AbstractLldbEvent:
    pass

class DebugEventInfo:
    pass
```

Note that this translation is not exact because the given code contains some concepts specific to Java (like packages, public/private access modifiers) which do not have direct equivalents in Python.
