Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import unittest
from ai_djl_translate import PoseEstimation

class TestPoseEstimation(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_pose_estimation(self):
        try:
            result = PoseEstimation.predict()
            self.assertTrue(result[0].confidence > 0.6)
        except (ModelException, TranslateException, IOException) as e:
            raise
```
Note that I used the `unittest` module to define a test case class, and the `assertTrue` method is replaced with the equivalent Python syntax using the `self.assertTrue()` method.

Also, since there is no direct equivalent of Java's `Joints` class in Python, I assumed it was some kind of data structure (e.g. list or tuple) containing joint information. In this example, I used a simple list comprehension to access the first element and its confidence value.
