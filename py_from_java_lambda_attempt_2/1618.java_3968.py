Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LldbSystemsEvent:
    def __init__(self, target_id):
        super().__init__(target_id)
```

Note that this Python class does not have direct equivalents to some Java concepts like `package`, `public`, and `extends`. The `__init__` method in the above code is equivalent to a constructor in Java.
