Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import unittest
from ai_djl_translate import TrainCaptcha

class TestTrainCaptcha(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_train_captcha(self):
        args = ["-g", "1", "-e", "1", "-m", "2"]
        result = TrainCaptcha.run_example(args)
        self.assertIsNotNone(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
Note that I've used the `unittest` module to define a test case, and the `assertNotNull` method has been replaced with the equivalent `self.assertIsNotNone` assertion. Additionally, I've assumed that the `TrainCaptcha.run_example` method is available in the `ai_djl_translate` package, which may require additional imports or setup depending on your specific use case.
