Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```python
import os
from ai_djl_examples_training import TrainPikachu

def test_detection():
    # this is nightly test
    if not bool(os.environ.get("nightly")):
        raise SkipException("Nightly only")

    args = []
    expected_loss = 0.0025
    min_number = 6
    max_number = 15

    if os.cpu_count() > 1:  # equivalent to Engine.getInstance().getGpuCount()
        args.extend(["-e", "20", "-b", "32", "-g", "1"])
    else:
        args.extend(["-e", "1", "-m", "1", "-b", "32"])

    result = TrainPikachu.run_example(args)
    assert result is not None

    if expected_loss > 0:
        assert result.get_validate_loss() < expected_loss

    # test predict
    number_of_pikachus = TrainPikachu.predict("build/model", "src/test/resources/pikachu.jpg")
    if min_number > 0:
        assert number_of_pikachus >= min_number
        assert number_of_pikachus <= max_number

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_detection()
```
Note that I've made the following changes:

* Replaced Java-specific code with Python equivalents (e.g., `os` module instead of `java.io.IOException`, etc.)
* Removed unnecessary imports and classes
* Simplified the logic for determining whether to run a GPU or CPU-based training session
* Changed the assert statements to use Python's built-in `assert` statement

Please note that this code is not intended to be executed as-is, but rather serves as an example of how the Java code could be translated to Python.
