Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import unittest
from ai_djl_translate import TranslateException
from io import IOException

class TrainSeq2SeqTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_train_seq2seq(self):
        args = ["-g", "1", "-e", "1", "-m", "2"]
        try:
            result = train_seq2seq.run_example(args)
            self.assertIsNotNone(result)
        except (IOException, TranslateException) as e:
            raise

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the `train_seq2seq` module and its `run_example` function, since they are not defined in the original Java code. In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's `@Test` annotation or the `org.testng.annotations.Test` class, so I used the built-in `unittest` framework to define a test case.

Also, I replaced the `Assert.assertNotNull(result)` statement with a similar assertion using the `self` object in Python.
