Here is the translation of the given Java-like comments into pure Python:

```

Note that there's no equivalent to Java-style comments (`/* */`) in Python; instead, we use `#` symbols at the beginning of a line to indicate a comment.

Also, since this is just a block of text with no actual code, I didn't translate anything else.
