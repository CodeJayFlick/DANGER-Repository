Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import os
from urllib.parse import urlparse

class S3RepositoryFactoryTest:
    def setUp(self):
        os.environ['AWS_REGION'] = 'us-east-1'

    def testUnsupportedProtocol(self):
        try:
            # This will raise an exception because "https" is not a supported protocol for s3.
            factory = S3RepositoryFactory()
            factory.newInstance("s3", urlparse('https://djl-not-exists/'))
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f'Expected {type(e)} but got {e}')

    def testS3RepositoryFactory(self):
        Repository.new_instance("s3", "s3://djl-not-exists?artifact_id=mlp&model_name=mlp")
        Repository.new_instance("s3", "s3://djl-not-exists")
        Repository.new_instance("s3", "s3://djl-not-exists/?model_name=mlp")

# Note: The above Python code is equivalent to the given Java code. However, it does not include any implementation of S3RepositoryFactory and Repository classes as they are specific to AWS SDK for Java.
```

This translation assumes that you have a `S3RepositoryFactory` class with an instance method called `newInstance`, which takes two parameters: protocol (string) and uri (URI object). It also assumes the existence of a `Repository` class with a static method called `new_instance`.
