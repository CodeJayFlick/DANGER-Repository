Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

                else:
                    results = list(executor_service.map(lambda x: x.result(), callables))

                for result in results:
                    if result is not None:
                        success_threads += 1

```

Note that the Python code does not exactly match the Java code. The main differences are:

1.  In Python, we use `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the `concurrent.futures` module to manage threads.
2.  We do not need a separate class for each thread like in Java; instead, we can define a callable function that will be executed by each worker thread.
3.  The `AtomicInteger` is replaced with Python's built-in integer type and its operations are implemented manually.

The rest of the code remains similar to the original Java code.
