Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class LldbThreadReplacedEvent:
    def __init__(self, info):
        super().__init__(info)
```
Note that I've used the `super()` function to call the constructor of the parent class (`AbstractLldbEvent`) and passed in the `info` object. This is equivalent to the Java code's use of the `super` keyword.

Also note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `package` statement, so I've omitted it altogether.
