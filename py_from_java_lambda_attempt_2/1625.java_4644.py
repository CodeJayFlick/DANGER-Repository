Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LldbThreadSuspendedEvent:
    def __init__(self, info):
        pass  # super().__init__(info) in Python does not exist like it does in Java


# Note: In Python, we don't need to declare classes or methods beforehand. We can directly define them.
```

Note that the given code is a part of an Agent for LLDB (Low-Level Debugger), which seems to be written in Java. The translation into equivalent Python might not exactly match the original functionality as it depends on how you would like your event handling mechanism implemented in Python.
