Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

class LldbCause:
    """Identifies the cause of an event emitted by lldb"""

    class Causes(enum.Enum):
        UNCLAIMED = None
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent to Java's `public interface` or `enum implements`. Instead, we define a regular class and use Python's built-in `enum` module for creating enums.
