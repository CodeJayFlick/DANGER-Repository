I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language instruction but rather a copyright notice, license agreement, and package declaration for Java.

Since you asked me to "translate" it to Python, I will assume you want me to provide an equivalent Python program. Here's what I came up with:

```python

print("Contains tests using the engine for ai.djl.translate.")
```

Please note that this Python code does not contain any actual programming logic but rather serves as a placeholder to demonstrate how you might structure your program if it were written in Python.
