I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language instruction or algorithm, but rather:

1. A copyright notice: This indicates who owns the intellectual property rights of the software.
2. A license statement: This explains how others can use and distribute the software.

As such, there is no Python translation to be done for this specific piece of text.
