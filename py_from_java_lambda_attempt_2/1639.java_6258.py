Here's a translation of the given Java interface into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LldbModelTargetAccessConditioned:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def is_accessible(self) -> bool:
        # Implement this method according to your needs.
        return False  # Default value.

    def set_accessible(self, accessible: bool) -> None:
        self._accessible = accessible
```

In the above Python code:

- The `LldbModelTargetAccessConditioned` class is defined as a simple interface with two methods. These methods are similar to those in Java.
- In the constructor (`__init__`) of this class, there's no specific implementation needed because it doesn't do anything by itself.
- The `is_accessible()` method should be implemented according to your needs and return either True or False depending on whether a target is accessible. By default, we're returning False here.
- In the `set_accessible()` method, you can set an instance variable `_accessible` with the given boolean value.
