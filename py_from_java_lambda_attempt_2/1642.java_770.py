Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from concurrent.futures import Future

class LldbModelTargetAttacher:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def attach(self, attachable: 'TargetAttachable') -> Future[None]:
        # Implement your logic here to attach a target.
        return None  # Replace with actual implementation.

    def attach(self, pid: int) -> Future[None]:
        # Implement your logic here to attach a target by PID.
        return None  # Replace with actual implementation.
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's interfaces and classes. Instead, we define a class `LldbModelTargetAttacher` in the above code which implements the same functionality as the given interface.

Also note that Python does not support type hints like `<T>` or generic types like Java. The type hinting is used to indicate the expected input/output types of methods and variables.
