Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
from typing import List, Any

class LldbModelTargetLauncher:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def launch(self, args: List[str]) -> Any:
        # Implement your logic here to handle launching targets.
        return None  # For now, just returning None as a placeholder.

# You can use this class like so:

target_launcher = LldbModelTargetLauncher()
args_list = ["arg1", "arg2"]
result = target_launcher.launch(args_list)
print(result)  # This will print: None
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's interfaces, classes or methods. Instead, it uses abstract base classes (ABCs), which are implemented by concrete subclasses.
