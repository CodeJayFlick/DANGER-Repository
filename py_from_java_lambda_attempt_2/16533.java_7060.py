Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```python
import io
from typing import Optional

class ManagedDescPriorityMergeReader:
    BATCH_SIZE = 4096

    def __init__(self, data_type: str):
        self.data_type = data_type
        self.managed_by_pool = False
        self.has_remaining = False
        self.batch_data = None

    @property
    def managed_by_query_manager(self) -> bool:
        return self.managed_by_pool

    @managed_by_query_manager.setter
    def set_managed_by_query_manager(self, value: bool):
        self.managed_by_pool = value

    @property
    def has_remaining_(self) -> bool:
        return self.has_remaining

    @has_remaining_.setter
    def set_has_remaining_(self, value: bool):
        self.has_remaining = value

    def hasNextBatch(self) -> Optional[bool]:
        if self.batch_data is not None:
            return True
        self.construct_batch()
        return self.batch_data is not None

    def construct_batch(self) -> None:
        while self.hasNextTimeValuePair() and len(self.batch_data) < self.BATCH_SIZE:
            next_time_value = self.nextTimeValuePair()
            self.batch_data.put(next_time_value.timestamp, next_time_value.value)

    @property
    def has_next_batch(self) -> bool:
        return self.hasNextBatch()

    def next_batch(self) -> Optional[io.IOError]:
        if not self.hasNextBatch():
            raise io.NoSuchElementException()
        ret = self.batch_data
        self.batch_data = None
        return ret

# Note: The following classes are not translated as they seem to be part of the Apache IoTDB library and may require additional dependencies or modifications.
TSDataType, TimeValuePair, BatchData, IPointReader
```
Note that some Java-specific features like `@Override` annotations have been removed in Python. Additionally, some methods like `hasNextTimeValuePair()` are not translated as they seem to be part of the Apache IoTDB library and may require additional dependencies or modifications.

Also, please note that this translation is done based on my understanding of the code, if there's any specific requirement or constraint you have for the Python version, let me know.
