Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
from typing import Any

class LldbModelTargetResumable:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def resume(self) -> Any:
        # Implement your logic here to handle the resume operation.
        return None  # Return type should be replaced with actual implementation.

```

Note: Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface concept. However, we can achieve similar functionality using abstract classes or protocols (in Python 3.8+). In this case, I've used a regular class to mimic the behavior of an interface in Java.
