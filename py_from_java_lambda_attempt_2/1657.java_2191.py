Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class LldbModelTargetAvailable:
    PID_ATTRIBUTE_NAME = "pid"

    def get_pid(self):
        pass  # TODO: implement this method

    def set_base(self, value):
        pass  # TODO: implement this method


from ghidra.dbg.target import TargetAttachable

LldbModelTargetAvailable = type('LldbModelTargetAvailable', (object,), {
    '__module__': 'agent.llldb.model.iface2',
    'PID_ATTRIBUTE_NAME': "pid",
    **asdict(TargetAttachable)
})
```

Please note that the `get_pid` and `set_base` methods are currently just placeholders, as they were in the original Java code. You would need to implement these methods according to your specific requirements.

Also, I used Python's type system to create a class with attributes similar to those found in the Java interface.
