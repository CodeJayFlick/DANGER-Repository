Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class LldbModelTargetAvailableContainer:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_target_attachable(self, pid: str) -> 'LldbModelTargetAvailable':
        # TO DO: implement this method
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")
```
Note that I've used Python's type hinting to indicate the return type of the `get_target_attachable` method. In Java, you would use a similar mechanism with annotations like `@Override`, but in Python, we rely on docstrings and type hints for documentation and static analysis.

Also, since this is an interface (in Java) or abstract class (in Python), I've left the implementation of the `get_target_attachable` method as a placeholder (`raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")`). In a real-world scenario, you would implement this method according to your specific requirements.
