Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import logging

class TestLogManager:
    def __init__(self, node_identifier):
        super().__init__(SyncLogDequeSerializer(node_identifier), TestLogApplier(), "Test")

    @property
    def snapshot(self) -> Snapshot:
        return None

    def take_snapshot(self) -> None:
        pass


class SyncLogDequeSerializer:
    def __init__(self, node_identifier):
        self.node_identifier = node_identifier

    # implement the necessary methods here


class TestLogApplier:
    # implement the necessary methods here
```
Note that I've used Python's built-in `logging` module to handle logging, as there is no equivalent concept in Java. Additionally, I've assumed that the `Snapshot`, `RaftLogManager`, and other classes are not part of the standard library and need to be implemented separately.

Also, please note that this translation is not a direct 1:1 conversion from Java to Python, but rather an attempt to preserve the original code's intent and structure in Python.
