Here's a translation of the Java interface into equivalent Python code:

```Python
class LldbModelTargetMemoryRegion:
    def get_range(self):
        # This method should return an AddressRange object in Python.
        pass  # Replace with actual implementation.

    def is_readable(self):
        # This method should return True if the memory region is readable, False otherwise.
        pass  # Replace with actual implementation.

    def is_writable(self):
        # This method should return True if the memory region is writable, False otherwise.
        pass  # Replace with actual implementation.

    def is_executable(self):
        # This method should return True if the memory region is executable, False otherwise.
        pass  # Replace with actual implementation.
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java's interfaces or classes. Instead, we define a class `LldbModelTargetMemoryRegion` in this case. The methods are defined as abstract methods (i.e., they do nothing) because the original interface is an abstract one and doesn't provide any implementation for these methods.
