Here is the translation of the Java interface `LldbModelTargetModuleContainer` to a Python class:

```python
import asyncio

class LldbModelTargetModuleContainer:
    def add_synthetic_module(self, name):
        # Implement this method in your subclass
        pass

    async def get_target_module(self, module):
        # Implement this method in your subclass
        return None

    def library_loaded(self, info: 'DebugModuleInfo', index: int) -> None:
        # Implement this method in your subclass
        pass

    def library_unloaded(self, info: 'DebugModuleInfo', index: int) -> None:
        # Implement this method in your subclass
        pass


class DebugModuleInfo:
    pass  # Define the class or interface here if needed
```

Note that I've used Python's `async` and `await` keywords to translate the Java `CompletableFuture` into a coroutine. In Python, you would typically use an asynchronous library like asyncio to handle concurrent operations.

I've also replaced the Java interfaces with equivalent Python classes. The `DebugModuleInfo` class is left undefined for now, as it's not clear what its definition should be based on the provided code snippet.
