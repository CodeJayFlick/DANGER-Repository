Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LldbModelTargetModuleSection:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_range(self) -> 'AddressRange':
        # Implement this method as per your requirement.
        pass


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AddressRange(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def __str__(self):
        pass

# You can also use Python's built-in range function if you want to represent the address range in a more straightforward way.

```

Please note that this translation is not exact as Java and Python are different languages with their own syntax, semantics, etc. The above code is just an equivalent representation of the given Java code in Python.
