Here is the translation of the Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class LldbModelTargetProcessContainer:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_target_process(self, process: 'SBProcess') -> 'LldbModelTargetProcess':
        # implement this method as needed
        return None  # or some default value if you want to return something
```

Note that I used the `->` syntax for type hints in Python. This is not a requirement but it can be helpful when working with other developers who are familiar with Java-like type systems.

Also, note that there's no direct equivalent of an interface in Java (like this one) in Python. In Python, you would typically define a class and then implement the methods as needed.
