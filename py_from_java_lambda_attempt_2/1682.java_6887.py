from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class LldbModelTargetSessionAttributes(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_lldb_model_target_environment(self) -> 'LldbModelTargetEnvironment':
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def set_lldb_events_listener_adapter(self, adapter: 'LldbEventsListenerAdapter'):
        pass

class LldbModelTargetEnvironment:
    # implement your logic here
    pass

class LldbEventsListenerAdapter:
    # implement your logic here
    pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface. However, we can achieve similar functionality using Abstract Base Classes (ABC) and abstract methods in Python.
