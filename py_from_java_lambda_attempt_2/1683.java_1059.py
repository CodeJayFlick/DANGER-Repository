Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This line is a comment in Python, similar to the /* */ comments in Java.
# It's not strictly necessary but can be useful for documentation.

class LldbModelTargetSessionAttributesEnvironment:
    # In Python, we don't have an exact equivalent of Java interfaces. 
    # However, we can achieve similar functionality using abstract base classes (ABCs).
    
    pass
```

Note that this translation does not exactly replicate the original code's structure or syntax. The `LldbModelTargetSessionAttributesEnvironment` class in Python is more like a blueprint for future objects rather than an interface as it would be in Java.

Also, note that there are no equivalent imports needed in Python because we're defining our own custom class here and not using any external libraries or modules.
