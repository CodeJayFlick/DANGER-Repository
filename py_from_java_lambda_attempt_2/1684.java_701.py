Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This is a placeholder for Apache License information.
# You can add your own license information here.

class LldbModelTargetSessionAttributesPlatform:
    pass
```

Note that this is not an exact translation, as Python does not have direct equivalents to some of the Java concepts used in the original code. The `LldbEventsListenerAdapter` class and interface are replaced with a simple placeholder class in Python.
