Here is the translation of the Java interface into a pure-Python class:

```Python
class LldbModelTargetStack:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_target_frame(self, frame):
        # Implement this method as needed for your specific use case.
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")
```

This Python code defines a class `LldbModelTargetStack` that has one method: `get_target_frame`. The method takes an argument of type `frame`, which is assumed to be some kind of frame object.
