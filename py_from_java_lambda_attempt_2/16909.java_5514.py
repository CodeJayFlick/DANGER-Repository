Here is the translation of the Java interface `IRoleAccessor` to a Python class:

```python
import io
from typing import List

class IRoleAccessor:
    def load_role(self, rolename: str) -> 'Role' or None:
        # implement this method in your subclass
        pass

    def save_role(self, role: 'Role') -> None:
        # implement this method in your subclass
        pass

    def delete_role(self, rolename: str) -> bool:
        # implement this method in your subclass
        pass

    def list_all_roles(self) -> List[str]:
        # implement this method in your subclass
        pass

    def reset(self) -> None:
        # implement this method in your subclass
        pass


class RoleAccessor(IRoleAccessor):
    # implement the methods of IRoleAccessor here
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's interfaces. Instead, we define an abstract base class `IRoleAccessor` and then create a concrete implementation `RoleAccessor`. The methods in `IRoleAccessor` are declared as abstract using the `pass` statement, which means they must be implemented by any subclass.

The `Role` object is not defined here since it's assumed to be part of another module or class.
