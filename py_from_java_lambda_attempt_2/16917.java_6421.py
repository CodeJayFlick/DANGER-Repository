Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class LocalFileUserManager:
    def __init__(self, user_dir_path):
        try:
            super().__init__(LocalFileUserAccessor(user_dir_path))
        except Exception as e:  # AuthException in Java is equivalent to Exception in Python
            raise
```
Note that I've removed the unnecessary comments and license information, as they are not relevant to the translation. Also, since there's no direct equivalent of `AuthException` in Python, I've caught all exceptions using a generic `Exception` catch-all.

The rest of the code is straightforward: we define a class `LocalFileUserManager` with an initializer method (`__init__`) that takes a `user_dir_path` parameter. The initializer calls the parent class's initializer (using `super()`) and passes it an instance of `LocalFileUserAccessor`.
