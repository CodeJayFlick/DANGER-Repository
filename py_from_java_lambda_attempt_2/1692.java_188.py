Here is the translation of the Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class LldbModelTargetSymbolContainer:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_target_symbol(self, symbol: 'SBSymbol') -> 'LldbModelTargetSymbolImpl':
        # This method should be implemented based on your requirements.
        pass


from ghidra.dbg.target import TargetSymbolNamespace
class LldbModelTargetObject:
    pass  # Should also implement the necessary methods.

# You can use this class to extend or modify it as per your needs.
```

Please note that Python does not have direct support for interfaces like Java. Instead, we define a base class and its subclasses in Python.
