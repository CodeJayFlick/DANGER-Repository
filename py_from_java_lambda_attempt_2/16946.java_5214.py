Here is the translation of the Java interface to a Python class:

```Python
class CacheHitRatioMonitorMXBean:
    def get_chunk_hit_ratio(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def get_chunk_eviction_count(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def get_chunk_cache_max_memory(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def get_chunk_cache_average_load_penalty(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def get_chunk_cache_average_size(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def get_time_series_metadata_hit_ratio(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def get_time_series_metadata_cache_eviction_count(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def get_time_series_metadata_cache_max_memory(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def get_time_series_cache_average_load_penalty(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def get_time_series_meta_data_cache_average_size(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def get_total_mem_table_size(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def get_flush_threshold(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def get_reject_threshold(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def flushing_mem_table_num(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass

    def total_mem_table_num(self):
        # implement your logic here
        pass
```

Please note that the above Python code is just a translation of the Java interface and does not include any actual implementation. You would need to add your own logic for each method based on how you want it to behave in your specific use case.
