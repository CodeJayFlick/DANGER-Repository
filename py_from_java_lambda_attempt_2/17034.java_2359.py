```

This code snippet is an example of a method that creates a new `TsFileResource` object and initializes it with data from another `TsFileResource`. The method takes two parameters: the original `TsFileResource` and the new `TsFileResource`.

The comments in this code are written using Javadoc-style syntax, which provides documentation for Java methods. Each comment is preceded by a `/**` directive.

Here's an example of how you might use this method:
```
TsFileResource original = ...; // create or load the original TsFileResource
TsFileResource newResource = TsFileResource.createHardlink(original);
if (newResource != null) {
    // do something with the new resource
}
```

    try (FileChannel channel = FileChannel.open(new File(newFileName), StandardOpenOption.CREATE, StandardOpenOption.WRITE)) {
        ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(1024);
        int bytesRead;
        while ((bytesRead = original.getChannel().read(buffer)) > 0) {
            channel.write(buffer.flip());
            buffer.clear();
        }
