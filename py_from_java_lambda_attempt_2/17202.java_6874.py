Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import logging

class BrokerAuthenticator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    def check_valid(self, client_id: str, username: str, password: bytes) -> bool:
        if not username or not password:
            return False

        try:
            authorizer = BasicAuthorizer()
            return authorizer.login(username, password.decode('utf-8'))
        except AuthException as e:
            self.logger.info("Meet error while logging in.", e)
            return False


class BasicAuthorizer:
    def login(self, username: str, password: str) -> bool:
        # Your logic to check the authentication
        pass

# Example usage:

authenticator = BrokerAuthenticator()
print(authenticator.check_valid('client_id', 'username', b'password'))
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `IAuthenticator` and `IAuthorizer`. I've created a simple example of how you could structure your code in Python. The actual implementation would depend on the specific requirements of your application.

Also, remember to install the required libraries if they are not already installed:

```shell
pip install logging
```

And for the BasicAuthorizer class, it's up to you what kind of authentication logic you want to implement there.
