Here is the translation of the Java interface `BatchPlan` to a Python class:
```python
class BatchPlan:
    def __init__(self):
        self._sub_plans_executed = []

    def set_sub_plan_executed(self, i: int) -> None:
        """Mark the sub-plan at position i as executed."""
        if 0 <= i < len(self._sub_plans_executed):
            self._sub_plans_executed[i] = True
        else:
            raise IndexError(f"Index {i} out of range")

    def unset_sub_plan_executed(self, i: int) -> None:
        """Mark the sub-plan at position i as not executed."""
        if 0 <= i < len(self._sub_plans_executed):
            self._sub_plans_executed[i] = False
        else:
            raise IndexError(f"Index {i} out of range")

    def is_sub_plan_executed(self, i: int) -> bool:
        """Whether the sub-plan at position i has been executed."""
        if 0 <= i < len(self._sub_plans_executed):
            return self._sub_plans_executed[i]
        else:
            raise IndexError(f"Index {i} out of range")

    @property
    def batch_size(self) -> int:
        """Return how many sub-plans are in the plan."""
        return len(self._sub_plans_executed)

    @property
    def results(self) -> dict:
        """Return execution status for each path"""
        return {i: TSStatus() for i in range(len(self._sub_plans_executed))}

    @property
    def prefix_paths(self) -> list:
        """Return prefix paths of all sub-plans"""
        # Note that this property does not actually store the prefix paths,
        # but rather returns an empty list. You would need to modify this class
        # if you want to store and return actual prefix path data.
        return []
```
Note that I used Python's built-in `list` type to represent the sub-plans, and a dictionary (`dict`) to represent the execution status for each path. The `TSStatus` object is not defined in this code snippet, as it appears to be specific to the Apache IoTDB project.

Also note that I did not translate the Java interface's comments into Python docstrings, but rather left them out entirely. If you want to include documentation with your Python class, you can add docstrings using triple quotes (`"""`) or the `"""`...`"""` syntax.
