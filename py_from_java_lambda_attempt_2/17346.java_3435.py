Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class ShowChildPathsPlan:
    def __init__(self, show_content_type: str, prefix_path: 'PartialPath') -> None:
        self.show_content_type = show_content_type
        self.prefix_path = prefix_path
        self.can_be_split = False

    @property
    def path(self) -> 'PartialPath':
        return self.prefix_path


class PartialPath:
    pass  # This is a placeholder, you may need to implement this class further depending on your use case.
```
Note that I've used type hints for the `show_content_type` and `prefix_path` parameters in the constructor, as well as for the `path` property. However, since Python does not have built-in support for classes like Java's `PartialPath`, I've simply defined a placeholder class with no implementation.

Also, I've used the `@property` decorator to implement a getter method for the `path` attribute, which is equivalent to the original Java code that returns the value of the `prefix_path` field.
