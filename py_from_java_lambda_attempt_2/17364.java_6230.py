Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import logging

class LogicalChecker:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # private constructor

    @staticmethod
    def check(operator: 'Operator') -> None:
        if isinstance(operator, QueryOperator):
            operator.check()
        elif isinstance(operator, SelectIntoOperator):
            operator.check()

class Operator:
    pass  # abstract class or interface in Python


class QueryOperator(Operator):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def check(self) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method")


class SelectIntoOperator(Operator):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def check(self) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method")
```
Note that I did not include the Apache license information, as it is not relevant to the translation itself. Also, in Python, we do not have a direct equivalent of Java's `throws` keyword for exceptions; instead, we use docstrings or type hints to indicate that a function may raise an exception.

Additionally, I used the `isinstance()` function from the built-in `typing` module (which is imported implicitly) to check if an object is an instance of a specific class. This is equivalent to Java's `instanceof` operator.
