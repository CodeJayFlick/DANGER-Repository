Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import math

class UDTFAsin:
    def __init__(self):
        self.transformer = None

    def set_transformer(self):
        self.transformer = math.asin
```
Note that in Python, we don't need an `@Override` annotation because method overriding is not explicitly declared. Also, the `protected` access modifier has no equivalent in Python (everything is public by default), so I removed it.

The rest of the code remains similar: we define a class `UDTFAsin`, which initializes with a `transformer` attribute set to None. The `set_transformer()` method sets the `transformer` attribute to the `math.asin` function, which is equivalent to the Java code's `Math::asin`.
