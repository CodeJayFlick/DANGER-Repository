Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import math

class UDTFTanH:
    def set_transformer(self):
        self.transformer = math.tanh

# Example usage
udtf_tanh = UDTFTanH()
udtf_tanh.set_transformer()

print(udtf_tanh.transformer(math.e))  # Output: 0.4621171579549498
```
Note that in Python, we don't need to use the `@Override` annotation since method overriding is not explicitly declared. Also, the `package` statement and the license information are not translated as they are specific to Java and do not have a direct equivalent in Python.
