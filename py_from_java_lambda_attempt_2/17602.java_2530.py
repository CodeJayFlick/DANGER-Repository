Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class CachedStringPool:
    _cached_pool = {}

    def get_cached_pool(self):
        return self._cached_pool

    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        if not hasattr(CachedStringPool, "_instance"):
            CachedStringPool._instance = cls()
        return CachedStringPool._instance


CachedStringPool._instance = None  # Initialize the instance holder
```
Note that I've used Python's built-in `dict` type to implement the `_cached_pool` attribute, and the `@classmethod` decorator to define a class method. The rest of the code is straightforward translation from Java to Python.

Also, in Python, we don't need to worry about explicit garbage collection or finalizers like we do in Java. The interpreter will take care of managing memory for us.
