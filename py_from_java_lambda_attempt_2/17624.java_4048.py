Here's how you can translate this Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod


class StartupCheck(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self) -> None:
        """Run some tests to check whether system is safe to be started."""
```

In the above code:

- We're using `metaclass` from Python's built-in module `abc` (Abstract Base Classes). This allows us to define an abstract class.
- The `StartupCheck` class inherits from this metaclass, making it an abstract base class itself.
