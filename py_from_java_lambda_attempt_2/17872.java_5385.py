Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import unittest
from io import StringIO
from contextlib import redirect_stdout
import time

class IoTDBRpcCompressionIT(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.rpc_thrift_compression = False
        self.rpc_advanced_compression = False

    def tearDown(self):
        pass

    @unittest.skip("Not implemented")
    def test_no_rpc_compression(self):
        with open('iotdb.log', 'w') as f:
            with redirect_stdout(f):
                do_something()

    @unittest.skip("Not implemented")
    def test_rpc_thrift_compression(self):
        self.rpc_thrift_compression = True
        try:
            with open('iotdb.log', 'w') as f:
                with redirect_stdout(f):
                    do_something()
        finally:
            self.rpc_thrift_compression = False

    @unittest.skip("Not implemented")
    def test_rpc_advanced_compression(self):
        self.rpc_advanced_compression = True
        try:
            with open('iotdb.log', 'w') as f:
                with redirect_stdout(f):
                    do_something()
        finally:
            pass

    @unittest.skip("Not implemented")
    def test_both_rpc_compression(self):
        self.rpc_thrift_compression = True
        self.rpc_advanced_compression = True
        try:
            with open('iotdb.log', 'w') as f:
                with redirect_stdout(f):
                    do_something()
        finally:
            pass

def do_something():
    # your code here
    print("do something")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

```

Note: The `@Before` and `@After` methods are not directly translated to Python, as they are specific to JUnit. Instead, the setup and teardown operations can be performed in separate methods or using context managers.

Also note that some parts of the code may need adjustments based on how you want your tests to run.
