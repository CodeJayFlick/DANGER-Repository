Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
import mysql.connector
from unittest import TestCase
import os


class IoTDBSettleIT(TestCase):
    sqls = []
    connection = None

    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        cls.sqls.append("SET STORAGE GROUP TO root.st1")
        cls.sqls.append("CREATE TIMESERIES root.st1.wf01.wt01.status WITH DATATYPE=BOOLEAN, ENCODING=PLAIN")
        for i in range(10):
            cls.sqls.append(f"insert into root.st1 wf01 wt01(timestamp,status) values({100 * (i + 1)},false)")
        cls.sqls.extend(["flush", "delete from root.st1.wf01.wt01.* where time<500"])

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        if cls.connection is not None:
            try:
                cls.connection.close()
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error closing connection: {e}")

    def test_online_settle_sg_test(self):
        try:
            self.connection = mysql.connector.connect(
                host='127.0.0.1',
                port=6667,
                user='root',
                password='root'
            )
            with self.connection.cursor() as cursor:
                for sql in self.sqls:
                    cursor.execute(sql)
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Error executing SQL: {e}")

    @classmethod
    def close(cls):
        if cls.connection is not None:
            try:
                cls.connection.close()
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error closing connection: {e}")
```

Please note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `@BeforeClass` and `@AfterClass`. Instead, you can use the class method decorator `@classmethod`, which is called before or after all test methods in the same class.
