Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import socket

class TimeoutChangeableTransport:
    def set_timeout(self, timeout: int):
        pass  # implement me!

    def get_time_out(self) -> int:
        raise socket.timeout
```
Note that I've kept the method signatures and variable names similar to the original Java code. However, in Python, we don't need explicit `throws` clauses or type annotations for methods.

Also, since this is an interface definition, there's no implementation provided (hence the `pass  # implement me!` comment). You would need to create a concrete class that implements this interface and provides actual implementations for these methods.
