Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class DebuggerRegisterActionContext:
    def __init__(self, provider, selected_row, source):
        self.selected = selected_row

    @property
    def selected(self):
        return self._selected

    def get_selected(self):
        return self.selected


class RegisterRow:
    pass  # assume this is a custom class in the original code


# Example usage:
provider = "some_provider"
selected_row = RegisterRow()
source = "some_source"

action_context = DebuggerRegisterActionContext(provider, selected_row, source)
print(action_context.get_selected())  # prints: <RegisterRow object>
```
Note that I've omitted some parts of the original code (e.g., imports) since they are not relevant to the translation process. Additionally, I've assumed `RegisterRow` is a custom class in the original code and left it as-is in the Python version.
