Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class NoProjectNameDockerComposeContainer:
    def __init__(self, identifier, *compose_files):
        super().__init__(identifier, compose_files)
        try:
            project = type(self).getattribute('project')
            setattr(project, self.__dict__, '')
        except AttributeError as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `package`, `import` statements or the specific classes and methods used in your code. The equivalent class definition is written directly into the Python file.

The `getDeclaredField()` method from Java has been replaced with a try-except block to access the attribute 'project' of the class using the built-in `getattr()` function, which returns the value of a named attribute of an object (here, it's the class itself). The equivalent for setting this attribute is done by calling `setattr()`, passing in the attribute name and its new value.
