Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Cache(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get(self, key: object) -> object:
        """Get an item from the cache by its key"""
        raise NotImplementedError("Must be implemented")

    @abstractmethod
    def clear(self) -> None:
        """Clear all items in the cache"""
        pass

class CacheException(Exception):
    pass

try:
    import io
except ImportError:  # Python < 3.7
    import StringIO as io
else:
    import io
```
Note that I've used the `ABC` class from the `abc` module to define an abstract base class, and the `@abstractmethod` decorator to indicate which methods must be implemented by any concrete subclass.

I've also defined a separate `CacheException` exception class, since there is no direct equivalent in Python.
