Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class WriteProcessException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message: str = None, cause: Exception = None) -> None:
        if message:
            super().__init__(message)
        elif cause:
            super().__init__(cause)

serialVersionUID = -2664638061585302767

def main():
    try:
        # Your code here
        pass
    except WriteProcessException as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Note that in Python, we don't need to specify the `public` access modifier or use a package declaration. Also, the concept of "serialVersionUID" is not directly applicable in Python.

The exception class is defined as a subclass of the built-in `Exception` class, with three constructors: one taking a message string, another taking an underlying cause exception, and a third constructor that takes both. The `super().__init__()` call initializes the parent class (in this case, `Exception`) with the provided arguments.

In the example code, I've also added a simple `main` function to demonstrate how you might use this exception in your Python program.
