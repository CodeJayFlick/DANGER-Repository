Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python code:

```Python
class ClipPathView:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def draw(self, canvas=None, paint=None, opacity=0):
        print("RNSVG: ClipPath can't be drawn, it should be defined as a child component for `Defs`")

    def save_definition(self):
        # Note that there is no equivalent method in Python to defineClipPath
        pass

    def is_responsible(self):
        return False

    def hit_test(self, src=None):
        return -1

    def merge_properties(self, target=None):
        pass

    def reset_properties(self):
        pass
