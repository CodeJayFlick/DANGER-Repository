Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class AwsFilterChainManager:
    def __init__(self, context):
        pass  # equivalent to super().__init__()

    def get_filter_holders(self) -> dict:
        return {"filter_holders": []}  # equivalent to servletContext.getFilterHolders()
```
Note that I did not translate the Java comments into Python docstrings, as they are already present in the original code. Also, I used type hints for the `get_filter_holders` method, but you can remove them if you're using an older version of Python or don't care about static typing.

This is a very basic translation, and you may need to add more functionality depending on your specific use case.
