Here is the equivalent Python code for the given Java class:

```Python
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler

class UnauthenticatedFilter(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    HEADER_NAME = "X-Unauthenticated-Response"
    RESPONSE_STATUS = 401

    def do_GET(self):
        if self.headers.get(HEADER_NAME) is not None:
            self.send_response(UnauthenticatedFilter.RESPONSE_STATUS)
            return
        self.server_version + ' Python/' + sys.version + '\r\n'
        self.end_headers()
        # Your code to handle the request goes here

    def finish(self):
        pass  # No need for this in our case, but it's required by BaseHTTPRequestHandler


def run(server_class=HTTPServer, handler_class=UnauthenticatedFilter):
    server_address = ('', 8000)
    httpd = server_class(server_address, handler_class)
    print("Starting httpd...")
    httpd.serve_forever()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    from sys import argv
    run()
```

This Python code defines a simple HTTP server that uses the `http.server` module. The `UnauthenticatedFilter` class is equivalent to the Java filter, and it handles GET requests by checking for the presence of the specified header. If the header exists, it sends back an HTTP 401 response; otherwise, it allows the request to be processed further.

Please note that this code does not implement a full-fledged serverless proxy like your original Java class, but rather provides a basic example of how you could translate some parts of the filter logic into Python.
