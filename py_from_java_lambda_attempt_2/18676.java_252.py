I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that translating Java code to Python is not a straightforward process, as both languages have different syntax, semantics, and ecosystems.

That being said, here's an attempt at rewriting the given Java code in pure Python:

```python
import asyncio
from aiohttp import web

class WebFluxTestApplication:
    pass
```

Please note that this translation is not a direct equivalent of the original Java code. The provided Java code appears to be related to Spring Boot and its various configurations, which are not directly applicable in Python.

In Python, you would typically use frameworks like Flask or Django for building web applications. If you're looking to create a serverless application with Python, you might consider using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions, along with libraries like Zappa or FastAPI.

If you could provide more context about what you're trying to achieve with this code, I'd be happy to help you explore the best options for your use case.
