Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import boto3

class StreamLambdaHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.handler = None

    def initialize_handler(self):
        try:
            self.handler = SpringLambdaContainerHandler(SpringApiConfig())
        except ContainerInitializationException as e:
            print("Could not initialize Spring framework", file=sys.stderr)
            raise RuntimeError(str(e))

    @staticmethod
    def get_handler():
        if StreamLambdaHandler().handler is None:
            StreamLambdaHandler().initialize_handler()
        return StreamLambdaHandler().handler

    def handle_request(self, inputStream, outputStream, context):
        self.get_handler().proxy_stream(inputStream, outputStream, context)

# Note: This code assumes you have a SpringApiConfig class defined elsewhere
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the Python equivalent of Java classes and methods. Specifically:

* The `SpringLambdaContainerHandler` class is not directly translatable to Python, so I created a simple wrapper class `StreamLambdaHandler` with an instance variable `handler`.
* The `getAwsProxyHandler` method was replaced with a static method `get_handler` that initializes the handler if it's not already initialized.
* The `proxy_stream` method was moved from the `SpringLambdaContainerHandler` class to the `StreamLambdaHandler` class, since it seems to be part of the request handling logic.

Also note that this code assumes you have a `SpringApiConfig` class defined elsewhere in your Python code. If not, you'll need to define or import that class as well.
