Here is a translation of the provided Groovy/Java code into pure Python:

```Python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.CRITICAL)

def main():
    print("Hello from Application!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that this is not exactly equivalent to the original Java/Groovy code. The `SpringApplication` and related classes are part of Spring Boot, which is a popular framework for building web applications in Java. Python has its own frameworks like Flask or Django, but they do things differently.

Here's what I did:

1. Removed all references to Spring Framework.
2. Set the logging level to CRITICAL (the highest severity).
3. Created a simple `main` function that prints "Hello from Application!" when run as an executable script.

This Python code does not have any direct equivalent to the original Java/Groovy code, but it's my best attempt at translating its essence into pure Python.
