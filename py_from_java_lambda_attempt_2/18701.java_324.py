Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class Pet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.id = None
        self.breed = None
        self.name = None
        self.date_of_birth = None

    @property
    def id(self):
        return self._id

    @id.setter
    def id(self, value):
        self._id = value

    @property
    def breed(self):
        return self._breed

    @breed.setter
    def breed(self, value):
        self._breed = value

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    from pet import Pet  # noqa: F401
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `package` statement. The above code is simply the translation of your provided Java class into Python, without any additional packaging or imports.

Also note that in Python, it's common practice to use underscore-prefixed private variables (like `_id`, `_breed`, etc.) and properties with getter/setter methods for encapsulation purposes.
