Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import logging
from micronaut import run_app

logging.basicConfig(level=logging TRACE)

def main():
    root_logger = logging.getLogger()
    root_logger.setLevel(logging.TRACE)
    run_app(__file__)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Note that I've used the `logging` module from Python's standard library to replicate the logback configuration, and the `micronaut` package is not a built-in Python package. You would need to install it separately using pip or another package manager.

Also, keep in mind that this translation assumes you have some basic understanding of both Java and Python programming concepts. If you're new to one or both languages, you may want to review the basics before attempting to translate code between them.
