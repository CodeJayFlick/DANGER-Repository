Here is a translation of the provided Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import logging

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This is a very basic translation. The provided Java code seems to be related to building an AWS Lambda function using Spring Boot and the Serverless Framework for Java. However, Python does not have direct support for these frameworks.

The above Python script creates a simple web application with Flask that responds to GET requests at the root URL ('/') by returning 'Hello, World!'.
