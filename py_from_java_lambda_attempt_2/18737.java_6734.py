Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AssignBranchBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def assign_to(self, reference: 'Reference') -> 'AssignBranchBuilder':
        return self

    async def assign(self) -> None:
        raise NessieNotFoundException("Nessie not found")
        #raise NessieConflictException("Nessie conflict")

class Reference:
    pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `@Valid` and `@NotNull` annotations. In this translation, I've simply omitted these annotations as they are used to validate the input in Java.

Also note that Python is an asynchronous language by design, so we use async/await syntax to define a coroutine (i.e., a function that can be paused and resumed).
