Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from typing import Dict, List
import json

class Contents:
    pass

class MultiGetContentsResponse:
    def __init__(self):
        self.contents: List[Dict] = []

def get_contents(key: str, ref: str = None, hash_on_ref: str = None) -> Contents:
    # Your implementation here
    return Contents()

def get_multiple_contents(ref: str = None, hash_on_ref: str = None, request: MultiGetContentsRequest):
    # Your implementation here
    response = MultiGetContentsResponse()
    for key in request.keys:
        contents = get_contents(key)
        if contents is not None:
            response.contents.append(contents.to_dict())
    return response

class NessieNotFoundException(Exception):
    pass

# Example usage:

request = {
    "keys": ["key1", "key2"]
}

response = get_multiple_contents(ref="ref", hash_on_ref=None, request=request)
print(json.dumps(response.__dict__, indent=4))
```

Please note that this is a direct translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python. The actual implementation may vary based on your specific requirements and use cases.

Also, please be aware that there are some limitations in translating Java to Python directly. For example:

- In Java, you can specify types for method parameters and return values using annotations like `@Consumes`, `@Produces`, etc. These do not have direct equivalents in Python.
- The OpenAPI-related annotations (`@Operation`, `@Parameter`, `@ExampleObject`, etc.) are specific to the MicroProfile API specification and may require additional libraries or frameworks for equivalent functionality in Python.

In general, it's recommended that you carefully review any Java-to-Python translation code before using it in production.
