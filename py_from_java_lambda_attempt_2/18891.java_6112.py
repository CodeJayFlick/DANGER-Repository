Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

import unittest
from test_jersey_resteasy_mongo import AbstractTestJerseyResteasy


class TestJerseyResteasyMongo(AbstractTestJerseyResteye):
    pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java annotations like `@NessieDbAdapterName` and `@NessieExternalDatabase`. These are used to specify database adapter name and external database in the test. In Python, you would typically use a class or function decorator to achieve similar functionality.

Also, there is no equivalent of Java's package declaration in Python.
