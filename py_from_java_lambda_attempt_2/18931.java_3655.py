import unittest

class ITNativeBasicOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java's annotations like `@NativeImageTest` or `@TestProfile`. The equivalent in Python is using decorators, but they are used for different purposes.
