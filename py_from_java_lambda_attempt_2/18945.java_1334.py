Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
# Copyright (C) 2020 Dremio

class QuarkusNativeProfileInmemory:
    def get_config_profile(self):
        return "prod"
```
Note that I've kept the copyright notice and license information, as they are not specific to a particular programming language. The rest of the code is simply translated from Java to Python using standard syntax conversions (e.g., `public class` becomes just `class`, `@Override` becomes nothing, etc.).
