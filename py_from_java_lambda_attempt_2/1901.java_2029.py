Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AbstractLldbModelHost:
    def get_factory_options(self):
        return {}
```

Note that this Python class does not inherit from any other classes or interfaces like it did in the original Java code, as Python's inheritance model and type system are different.
