Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Copyright (C) 2020 Dremio

from typing import Any

class DatabaseConnectionConfig:
    """Base database-connection-provider configuration type."""
```

Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we use the term "class" and define methods as abstract by not providing an implementation for them (i.e., leaving them empty).
