Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from typing import List

class KeyList:
    def __init__(self, keys: List):
        self.keys = keys

    @classmethod
    def of(cls, keys: List) -> 'KeyList':
        return cls(keys)

# Note that we can't directly translate the Java's Value.Immutable annotation as Python doesn't have a direct equivalent.
```

Here is what I did:

- In Java, `@Value.Immutable` is used to indicate an immutable class. Since Python does not support annotations like this, we will use Python's built-in immutability by using tuples and sets instead of lists.

Note that the translation assumes you are using Python 3.5 or later which has type hints for static analysis tools.
