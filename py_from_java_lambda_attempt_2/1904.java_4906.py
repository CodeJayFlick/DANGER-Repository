Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
class AbstractModelForLldbFactoryTest:
    def get_failing_factory_options(self):
        # TODO: No options to test for IN-VM variant
        return {}
```

Note that I've removed all imports and annotations as they are not directly translatable to Python. The `getFailingFactoryOptions` method has been renamed to `get_failing_factory_options` following PEP 8 conventions.
