import unittest

class TestDatabaseAdapterMongo(unittest.TestCase):
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `package`, `@NessieExternalDatabase` and other annotations. The equivalent way to achieve similar functionality in Python is by using modules, classes, inheritance, etc.
