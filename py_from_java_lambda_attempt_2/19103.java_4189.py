Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

import unittest

class TestVersionStoreH2(unittest.TestCase):
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's annotations (`@NessieDbAdapterName` and `@NessieExternalDatabase`). In Python, you would typically use docstrings or comments to provide additional information about the class.
