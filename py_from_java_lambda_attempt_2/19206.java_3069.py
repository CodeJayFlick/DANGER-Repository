class SerializableGetter(metaclass=type):
    def __init__(self, R=None, A=None):
        super().__init__()

    @property
    def is_deprecated(self) -> bool:
        return True

# This class is abstract and does not have any methods or properties.
```

Please note that Python doesn't support Java-like generics (type parameters), so I removed the `<R, A>` part. Also, there's no direct equivalent of Java's `@Deprecated` annotation in Python; instead, you can use a property to indicate whether an object is deprecated or not.
