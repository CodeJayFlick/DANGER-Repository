class InVmModelForLldbScenarioCloneExitTest:
    def model_host(self):
        return InVmLldbModelHost()

class AbstractModelForLldbScenarioCloneExitTest:
    pass

class InVmLldbModelHost:
    pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `package`, `import` and some other constructs. The above code is a simple translation, it may need to be adjusted based on the actual use case.
