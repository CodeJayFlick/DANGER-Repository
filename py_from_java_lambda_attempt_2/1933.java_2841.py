Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python

class InVmModelForLldbSteppableTest:
    def model_host(self):
        return InVmLldbModelHost()
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `package`, `import`, and `public` keywords, so they are omitted in the translation.
