Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
class KickEffect:
    def __init__(self):
        self.players = None
        self.reason = None

    @staticmethod
    def register_effect():
        Skript.register_effect(KickEffect, "kick %players% [(by reason of|because [of]|on account of|due to) %-string%]")

    def init(self, exprs):
        if len(exprs) != 2:
            return False

        self.players = exprs[0]
        self.reason = exprs[1]

        return True

    def __str__(self):
        if not hasattr(self, 'reason') or self.reason is None:
            return "kick %players%"
        else:
            return f"kick {self.players} on account of {self.reason}"

    def execute(self, event):
        reason = self.reason.get(event) if self.reason else ""
        for player in self.players.get_array(event):
            if isinstance(event, PlayerLoginEvent) and player == event.player and not Delay.is_delayed(event):
                ((PlayerLoginEvent)event).disallow(PlayerLoginEvent.Result.KICK_OTHER, reason)
            elif isinstance(event, PlayerKickEvent) and player == event.player and not Delay.is_delayed(event):
                ((PlayerKickEvent)event).set_leave_message(reason)
            else:
                player.kick_player(reason)

class Skript:
    @staticmethod
    def register_effect(effect_class, pattern):
        pass

class Expression:
    def get_array(self, event):
        return []

    def get_single(self, event):
        return None


# Usage example:

kick = KickEffect()
Skript.register_effect(kick.__class__, "kick %players% [(by reason of|because [of]|on account of|due to) %-string%]")

def main():
    kick.init(["player1", "reason"])
    event = PlayerLoginEvent()  # Replace with actual event
    kick.execute(event)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that this is a simplified translation and may not work exactly as the original Java code. Python has different syntax, data types, and libraries than Java, so some parts of the code might need to be adjusted or rewritten for compatibility.
