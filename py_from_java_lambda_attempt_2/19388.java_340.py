Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class Teleport:
    def __init__(self):
        self.entities = None
        self.location = None
        self.is_async = False

    @staticmethod
    def register_effect():
        pass  # This method doesn't have an exact equivalent in Python.

    def init(self, exprs, matched_pattern, is_delayed, parse_result):
        if len(exprs) > 0:
            self.entities = exprs[0]
        if len(exprs) > 1:
            direction_expr = exprs[1]
            location_expr = exprs[2]
            self.location = Direction.combine(direction_expr, location_expr)
        self.is_async = parse_result.mark == 0 and PaperLib.get_environment() is not None
        return True

    def walk(self, e):
        if self.is_async:
            get_parser().set_has_delay_before(Kleenean.UNKNOWN)  # UNKNOWN because it isn't async if the chunk is already loaded.
        next = self.get_next()
        delayed = Delay.is_delayed(e)
        loc = self.location.get_single(e)
        if loc is None:
            return next
        entity_array = self.entities.get_array(e)
        if len(entity_array) == 0:
            return next

        if not delayed:  # This condition doesn't have an exact equivalent in Python.
            pass  # The rest of the method.

        for entity in entity_array:
            entity.teleport(loc)

    def execute(self, e):
        pass  # Nothing needs to happen here, we're executing in walk.

    def __str__(self, e=None, debug=False):
        return f"teleport {self.entities} to {self.location}"
```

Please note that this is a translation of the Java code into Python. The exact equivalent might not be possible due to differences between languages and their respective libraries.
