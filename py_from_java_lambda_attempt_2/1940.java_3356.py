from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
class GadpClientTargetAccessConditioned(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    # Nothing to add
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `package`, `public interface`, and `extends` keywords. The equivalent concept in Python is the use of modules, classes, and inheritance through subclassing.
