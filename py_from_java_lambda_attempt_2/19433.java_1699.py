I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided Java-like comments and annotations are not directly translatable to Python.

Python is a dynamically-typed language with its own syntax and conventions for commenting and documenting code. Here's an example of how you might write equivalent documentation in Python:

```
# This module provides custom event classes for Bukkit
#
# Copyright (C) [Your Name]
# License: GNU General Public License, version 3 or later

from typing import Any

class CustomEvent:
    # Your event class definition goes here
    pass
```

Note that I've omitted the Java-style comments and annotations, as they are not directly applicable to Python. Instead, I've provided a brief description of what the module does, along with some basic documentation for the `CustomEvent` class.

If you'd like me to translate any specific code from Java to Python, please let me know!
