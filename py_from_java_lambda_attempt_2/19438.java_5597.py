Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

class SkriptParseEvent:
    handlers = None

    def get_handlers(self):
        return self.handlers

    @classmethod
    def get_handler_list(cls):
        if cls.handlers is None:
            cls.handlers = HandlerList()
        return cls.handlers


# Define a class for handling events in Python, similar to Java's Event and HandlerList classes.
class HandlerList:
    handlers = []

    def add_handler(self, handler):
        self.handlers.append(handler)

    def get_handlers(self):
        return self.handlers
```

Please note that this is not exactly the same as the original code. The `HandlerList` class in Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `HandlerList`. In Python, you would typically use a list or another data structure to store handlers and iterate over them manually when processing events.
