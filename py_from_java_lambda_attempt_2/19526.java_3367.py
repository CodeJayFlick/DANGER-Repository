Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class ExprCursorSlot:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @property
    def name(self):
        return "Cursor Slot"

    @name.setter
    def name(self, value):
        self._name = value

    @property
    def description(self):
        return "The item which the player has on their cursor. This slot is always empty if player has no inventories open."

    @description.setter
    def description(self, value):
        self._description = value

    @property
    def examples(self):
        return ["cursor slot of player is dirt", 
                "set cursor slot of player to 64 diamonds"]

    @examples.setter
    def examples(self, value):
        self._examples = value

    @property
    def since(self):
        return "2.2-dev17"

    @since.setter
    def since(self, value):
        self._since = value

    def get_return_type(self):
        return Slot

    def get_property_name(self):
        return "cursor slot"

    def convert(self, player: 'Player') -> Slot:
        return CursorSlot(player)
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `@Override`, `@Name`, `@Description`, etc. annotations. These are used to provide documentation and metadata about the class or method in a way that can be read by tools like IDEs, code analysis software, and documentation generators.

In this translation, I've simply omitted these annotations as they do not have direct equivalent in Python.
