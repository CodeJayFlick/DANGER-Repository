Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import asyncio

class GadpClientTargetDeletable:
    def delete(self):
        await self.get_delegate().assert_valid()
        reply = await self.get_model().send_checked(
            Gadp.DeleteRequest(path=self.path),
            Gadp.DeleteReply.getDefaultInstance())
        return None

async def main():
    # create an instance of GadpClientTargetDeletable
    client_target_deletable = GadpClientTargetDeletable()

    try:
        await client_target_deletable.delete()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the Python equivalent of Java concepts, such as:

* `CompletableFuture` is replaced with an asynchronous function using the `asyncio` library.
* `GadpValueUtils.makePath()` and `getPath()` are assumed to be methods on the `GadpClientTargetDeletable` class that return a path string.
* The rest of the Java code was translated directly into Python, assuming equivalent functionality.

Please note that this is just an approximation, as I don't have access to the original Java code or its specific requirements.
