class GadpClientTargetExecutionStateful:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    # Nothing to add
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we define a class with no methods or attributes. The purpose of this code is likely to provide an abstract base class for other classes in the Ghidra framework, but since there are no concrete implementations or method definitions, it can be represented as a simple Python class.
