Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class ExprParseError:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # Skript.registerExpression(ExprParseError.class, String.class, ExpressionType.SIMPLE, "[the] [last] [parse] error")

    @property
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "The error which caused the last parse operation to fail," \
               "which might not be set if a pattern was used and the" \
               "pattern didn't match the provided text at all."

    @property
    def examples(self):
        return ["set {var} to line 1 parsed as integer",
                "if {var} is not set:",
                "    parse error is set:",
                "        message \"<red>Line 1 is invalid: %last parse error%\"",
                "    else:",
                "        message \"<red>Please put an integer on line 1!\""]

    @property
    def since(self) -> str:
        return "2.0"

    def init(self, exprs: list[Expression], matched_pattern: int, is_delayed: Kleenean, parse_result: ParseResult):
        return True

    def get(self, e: Event):
        if ExprParse.last_error is None:
            return []
        else:
            return [ExprParse.last_error]

    @property
    def single(self) -> bool:
        return True

    def get_return_type(self) -> type[str]:
        return str

    def __str__(self, e: Event = None, debug: bool = False):
        if not isinstance(e, Event):
            raise TypeError("Event is required")
        return "the last parse error"
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's static block. Also, the `@Name`, `@Description`, `@Examples` and `@Since` are just docstrings in Python.

The Kleenean class seems to be a custom class which is used for boolean values with an additional "delayed" property. In Python, you can use built-in bool type or create your own class if needed.

The ParseResult class also seems to be a custom class and its usage might vary based on the actual implementation in Java.
