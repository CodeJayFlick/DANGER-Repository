class GadpClientTargetSectionContainer:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    # Nothing to add
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we define a class with no methods or attributes. The `extends` clause is also not present in Python, as it is specific to Java's inheritance mechanism.
