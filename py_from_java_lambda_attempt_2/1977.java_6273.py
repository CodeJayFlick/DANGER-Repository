Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python

# You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

class GadpClientTargetStack:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent to Java's interface concept, so we've used a class instead with no methods or attributes defined in this case (as per the comment "Nothing to add").
