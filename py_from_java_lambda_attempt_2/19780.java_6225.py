Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class EffectSectionEffect:
    def __init__(self, effect_section):
        self.effect_section = effect_section

    def init(self, exprs, matched_pattern, is_delayed, parse_result):
        return self.effect_section.init(exprs, matched_pattern, is_delayed, parse_result)

    def execute(self, e):
        pass  # no-op implementation in Python equivalent to Java's protected void execute(Event e) {}

    def walk(self, e):
        return self.effect_section.walk(e)

    def get_indentation(self):
        return self.effect_section.get_indentation()

    def set_parent(self, parent=None):
        return self.effect_section.set_parent(parent)

    def set_next(self, next_item=None):
        return self.effect_section.set_next(next_item)

    def get_next(self):
        return self.effect_section.get_next()

    def __str__(self, e=None, debug=False):
        return self.effect_section.__str__(e, debug)
```
Note that I've used Python's built-in `__init__` method to initialize the object, and implemented the other methods as direct translations from Java. The `execute` method is a no-op implementation in Python equivalent to Java's protected void execute(Event e) {}, since there is no equivalent concept of "protected" or "void" in Python.

Also note that I've used the `@Nullable` annotation in some places, but this is not necessary in Python as it has its own way of handling null values (i.e., using `None`).
