Here's a translation of your Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class EffFunctionCall:
    def __init__(self, function):
        self.function = function

    @staticmethod
    def parse(line):
        try:
            function = SkriptParser().parse_function(line)
            if function is not None:
                return EffFunctionCall(function)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error parsing line: {e}")
        return None

    def execute(self, event):
        self.function.execute(event)

    def __str__(self, event=None, debug=False):
        return str(self.function)

class SkriptParser:
    @staticmethod
    def parse_function(line):
        # Implement your logic to parse the function here.
        pass

import kleenean  # Assuming this is a Python module that provides Kleenean class.

def main():
    eff_func = EffFunctionCall(None)
    print(eff_func)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that I've not implemented all the methods in your Java code as they seem to be specific to Skript, a plugin for Minecraft. You would need to implement these methods according to how you want them to behave in Python.

Also, `SkriptParser` and `Kleenean` are classes that don't exist in this translation because their implementation is not provided in your Java code.
