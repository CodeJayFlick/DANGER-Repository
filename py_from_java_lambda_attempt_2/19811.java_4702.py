Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class SyntaxElement:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def init(self, exprs: list, matched_pattern: int, is_delayed: bool, parse_result: dict) -> bool:
        # Implement your logic here. For example:
        print("Initializing syntax element...")
        return True  # Replace with actual initialization result.

    @property
    def parser_instance(self):
        from . import ParserInstance
        return ParserInstance.get()
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's interfaces, classes, and methods. However, we can achieve similar functionality using abstract base classes (ABCs) or regular classes with a specific naming convention.

In this translation:

- The `SyntaxElement` class is equivalent to the original interface.
- The `init` method corresponds to the `public boolean init(...)` in Java.
- The `getParser` method, which was marked as default (`default ParserInstance getParser()`) in Java, has been translated into a property named `parser_instance`.
