Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```

class LanguageChangeListener:
    def on_language_change(self):
        pass

```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we define a class with methods that can be implemented by other classes. In this case, the `LanguageChangeListener` class has one method called `on_language_change`, which is similar to the original Java code.
