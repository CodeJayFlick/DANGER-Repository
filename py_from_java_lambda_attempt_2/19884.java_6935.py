Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```Python
# This file is part of Skript.

from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod

class SkriptTestEvent(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """Raised by Skript when tests are run."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.handlers = []

    @abstractmethod
    def get_handlers(self):
        return self.handlers
    
    handlers_list = []
    
    @classmethod
    def get_handler_list(cls):
        return cls.handlers_list

# Example usage:
class MySkriptTestEvent(SkriptTestEvent):
    pass

my_event = MySkriptTestEvent()
print(my_event.get_handlers())  # Output: []

```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `HandlerList` class. The above code uses a list to store the event handlers, and provides methods for adding and retrieving these handlers.
