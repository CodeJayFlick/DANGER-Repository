Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class Color:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def as_bukkit_color(self):
        # Implement this method with your own logic or placeholder
        return None  # Replace None with actual implementation
    
    def as_dye_color(self) -> DyeColor | None:
        # Implement this method with your own logic or placeholder
        return None  # Replace None with actual implementation
    
    def get_name(self):
        # Implement this method with your own logic or placeholder
        return ""  # Replace "" with actual implementation

class DyeColor:  # This is not a built-in Python class, you might need to implement it yourself
    pass
```

Please note that the `DyeColor` in Java seems to be an enum. In Python, we don't have direct equivalent of enums but we can use classes or constants for similar purposes.

Also, please replace the placeholder implementations (`return None`) with your actual logic and data structures as per your requirements.
