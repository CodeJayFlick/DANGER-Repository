Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's package declaration or annotations. The equivalent way to achieve similar functionality in Python is by using docstrings, comments, and type hints.

The `@NonNullByDefault` annotation is used to specify the default nullability of parameters, return types, and fields in a class. In Python, this can be achieved through type hints and function documentation.
