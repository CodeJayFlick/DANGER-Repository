This is a simple class that extends the functionality of `DatabaseStorage` with some additional methods. It's not meant to be used directly, but rather as an example or for testing purposes.

Here are some key points about this code:

1.  This class has been designed to work seamlessly with other classes and objects.
2. The constructor takes a string parameter representing the database name.
3. The `save` method is overridden to allow saving of variables without specifying their types.
4. The `load_ii` method loads data from an old variable table (hadNewTable) if it exists, otherwise uses the current storage instance.
5. There are some deprecated methods and classes that can be used for testing purposes only.

This code has been written in a way to make it easy to understand and modify. It's not meant to be used directly without understanding its purpose and functionality.
