Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

Note that the given Java code contains annotations (`@NonNullByDefault`, `package`) which are not directly translatable into Python. The above translation only includes the comments, copyright information and a brief description of what the file is about.

Here's why:

- Annotations in Java like `@NonNullByDefault` or `package ch.njol.skript.variables;` do not have direct equivalents in Python.
- Python does not support annotations as strongly as Java. While you can use docstrings to provide information about your code, there isn't a built-in way to add metadata to variables or functions like you would with Java's annotations.

So the above translation is essentially just copying over the comments and copyright information from the original Java file into Python.
