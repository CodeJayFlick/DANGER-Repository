Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import typing as t

class Predicate(t.Generic[T]):
    def __call__(self, param_t: t.Optional[T]) -> bool:
        ...
```
Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's `abstract interface` concept. Instead, we define an abstract class using the `Generic` type hint from the `typing` module.

The `__call__` method is used to implement the `test` method from the original Java code. The `t.Optional[T]` type hint indicates that the `param_t` parameter can be either a value of type `T` or `None`.
