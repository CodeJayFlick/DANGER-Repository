Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import threading

class SynchronizedReference:
    def __init__(self, value=None):
        self._value = value

    @property
    def value(self):
        with self.lock:
            return self._value

    @value.setter
    def value(self, new_value):
        with self.lock:
            self._value = new_value

    def __init_lock(self):
        if not hasattr(self, 'lock'):
            self.lock = threading.Lock()

    lock = property(__init_lock)

class Nullable:
    pass  # equivalent to Java's @Nullable annotation
```
Note that I've used Python's built-in `property` decorator to implement the getter and setter methods for the `_value` attribute. This allows you to access the value using a syntax similar to Java, e.g., `synchronized_ref.value`.

I've also defined an empty class called `Nullable`, which is equivalent to Java's `@Nullable` annotation.

The rest of the code remains largely unchanged from the original Java implementation.
