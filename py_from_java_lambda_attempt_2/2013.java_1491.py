Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This is a placeholder for Apache License information.
# You can add your own license or copyright notice here.

class JdiMemoryMapping:
    pass
```

Note that in Python, we don't have direct equivalents to Java's `package`, `public interface`, and other constructs. Instead, we use modules (`.py` files) and classes to organize our code. The above translation is a simple class definition with no methods or attributes, equivalent to the empty interface in Java.
