Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class JdiTargetOutputListener:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def output(self, out: str) -> None:
        """The target outputted some text"""
        print(out)
```

Note that in this translation, I have not implemented any specific functionality for the `JdiTargetOutputLicense` as it seems to be a license agreement and does not translate directly into Python.
