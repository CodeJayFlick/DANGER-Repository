Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class JdiModelTargetConsole:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    # This interface indicates this object is capable of launching targets.
    # The targets this launcher creates ought to appear in its successors.
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's interfaces. Instead, we can define a class with no methods or attributes, which serves as an abstract base class (ABC) for other classes to inherit from.

Also, the `<T>` type parameter is specific to Java generics and has no direct equivalent in Python.
