Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
from concurrent.futures import Future

class JdiModelTargetInterruptible:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def interrupt(self) -> Future[None]:
        return Future()
```

Please note that in this translation, I have not implemented any actual functionality for the `interrupt` method. The Java code is using a specific concurrency library (`java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture`) which does not exist in Python. In Python, we can use the built-in `asyncio` module or third-party libraries like `trio` to achieve similar results.

Also note that I have removed any type parameters `<T>` as they are not supported in Python.
