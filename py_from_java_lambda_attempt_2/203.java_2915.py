Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class DebuggerWatchActionContext:
    def __init__(self, provider, selected_watches, source_component):
        self.selected_watches = set(selected_watches)
        super().__init__(provider, selected_watches, source_component)

    def get_watch_row(self):
        if len(self.selected_watches) == 1:
            return next(iter(self.selected_watches))
        return None

    def get_watch_rows(self):
        return self.selected_watches
```
Note that I've used the following Python concepts to translate the Java code:

* Classes and inheritance: `class DebuggerWatchActionContext:` defines a new class, while `super().__init__(provider, selected_watches, source_component)` calls the parent constructor.
* Sets: In Python, sets are implemented using the built-in `set` type. I've used this to translate the Java `Set<WatchRow>` into a Python set of watch rows.
* Iterators and next(): The Java code uses an iterator to get the single element in the set; in Python, we can use the `next()` function from the `iter` object to achieve similar behavior.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
