Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# No license information or copyright notices are included in this Python version.

class JdiModelTargetMethod(JdiModelTargetObject):
    pass
```

Note that there's no direct equivalent to Java interfaces in Python. Instead, you can use abstract base classes (ABCs) with the `@abstractmethod` decorator if you want to define a set of methods that must be implemented by any subclass.

Here is an example using ABC:

```Python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class JdiModelTargetMethod(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def method(self):  # Replace this with actual method implementation.
        pass
```

In the above code, `JdiModelTargetMethod` is a base class that defines an abstract method. Any subclass of `JdiModelTargetMethod` must implement this method.
