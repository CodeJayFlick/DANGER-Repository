Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
from concurrent.futures import Future

class JdiModelTargetResumable:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def resume(self) -> Future[None]:
        # Implement your logic here to launch targets and return a future.
        pass
```

Note that the `CompletableFuture` in Java is equivalent to the `Future` class in Python. The `resume()` method now returns a `Future`, which represents an asynchronous operation that may complete at some point in the future, producing a result (in this case, `None`).
