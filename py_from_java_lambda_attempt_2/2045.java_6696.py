Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class JdiModelTargetElementsContainer:
    def __init__(self, parent: 'JdiModelTargetObject', name):
        super().__init__(parent, name)

    @property
    def thread_groups_by_id(self) -> dict:
        return {}

    def add_elements(self, els: list):
        self.set_elements(els, {}, "Initialized")

class JdiEventsListenerAdapter:
    pass

class TargetElementType(type):
    pass

class TargetAttributeType(type):
    pass

class ResyncMode:
    ONCE = None
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `@TargetObjectSchemaInfo`, `@TargetElementType` and other annotations. These are used for schema definition in Java, which is a complex topic. The above code only translates the class structure and methods from Java to Python.

Also, please be aware that this translation may not work perfectly without further adjustments as it was done automatically by me.
