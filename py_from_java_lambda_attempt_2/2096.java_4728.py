Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This part is a license notice, not relevant for this translation.

from typing import TypeVar, Generic

R = TypeVar('R')
T = TypeVar('T')

class AsyncLoopFirstActionProduces(Generic[R, T]):
    def __call__(self, handler: 'AsyncLoopHandlerForFirst[R, T]'):
        pass  # Nothing to do here
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface concept. Instead, we use abstract classes or protocols (in the context of type hinting). In this case, I used a generic class as an approximation of the original Java interface.

Also, please be aware that translating code from one language to another is not always straightforward and may require adjustments based on specific requirements and constraints.
