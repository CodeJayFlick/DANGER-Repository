Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
# TODO: Could probably just have take() go straight to recording.....
class DebuggerTargetTraceMapper:
    def get_trace_language(self):
        # TO DO: implement this method
        pass

    def get_trace_compiler_spec(self):
        # TO DO: implement this method
        pass

    def start_recording(self, service: 'DebuggerModelServicePlugin', trace: ' Trace'):
        # TO DO: implement this method
        pass
```
Note that I've kept the TODO comments and placeholder methods as they were in the original Java code. In Python, we don't need to declare types for variables or methods like we do in Java, so the `get_trace_language`, `get_trace_compiler_spec`, and `start_recording` methods are simply defined with a colon (`:`) followed by an empty body (i.e., `pass`).
