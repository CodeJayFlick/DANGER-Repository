Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Define a class for TargetDataTypes
class TargetDataType:
    UNDEFINED1 = DefaultTargetPrimitiveDataType(PrimitiveKind.UNDEFINED, 1)

# Import necessary modules (equivalent to Java imports)
from ghidra_dbg_attributes import * 

```

Please note that this translation is not exact as Python does not support interfaces like in Java. Also, the `DefaultTargetPrimitiveDataType` and `PrimitiveKind` classes are not defined here as they were part of the original Java code.
