Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class TargetPointerDataType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    class DefaultTargetPointerDataType(TargetPointerDataType):
        def __init__(self, referent_type: 'TargetPointerType') -> None:
            self.referent_type = referent_type

        def get_referent_type(self) -> 'TargetPointerType':
            return self.referent_type
```
Note that I did not include the boilerplate code (e.g. license information, etc.) as it is not relevant to the translation itself.

Also, in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's `interface` or `public`. Instead, we define classes and methods using the syntax above. The `@Override` annotation is also not necessary in Python, as method overriding works differently than in Java.
