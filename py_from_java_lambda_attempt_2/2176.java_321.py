Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

class TargetAggregate:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    # Often applied to processes and sessions, this causes ancestry traversals
    # to include this object's children when visited.

TargetAggregate = type('TargetAggregate', (object,), {})
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java interfaces. However, we can achieve similar functionality using abstract classes or duck typing in Python. In the above code, `TargetAggregate` is an example of a class which represents the interface-like behavior in Python.
