Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class TargetAttachable:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

# Note: In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent for interfaces like in Java.
# Instead, you can use abstract classes or protocols. Here's an example using 
# protocol (a new feature introduced in Python 3.8):

from typing import Protocol

class TargetAttachableProtocol(Protocol):
    pass
```

Note that the above code is not a direct translation of the given Java interface `TargetAttachable`. Instead, it provides equivalent functionality using abstract classes and protocols available in Python.

The original Java code defines an interface called `TargetAttachable` which extends another interface `DebuggerTargetObjectIface`, but this concept doesn't directly translate to Python.
