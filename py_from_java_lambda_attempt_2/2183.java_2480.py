Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import asyncio

class TargetConfigurable(ABC):
    BASE_ATTRIBUTE_NAME = "base"

    async def write_configuration_option(self, key: str, value) -> asyncio.Future:
        # This method should probably be replaced with a configure(options) method.
        pass  # TODO: Implement this properly in all subclasses to advertise their parameters.

    @abstractmethod
    async def get_configurable_options(self) -> dict:
        return {}
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's interfaces, classes and methods. In the above code:

- The `TargetConfigurable` class is a subclass of ABC (Abstract Base Class), which means it can contain abstract methods.
- The `write_configuration_option` method has been translated into an asynchronous function using asyncio.Future.
- The `get_configurable_options` method has also been translated into an asynchronous function and marked as abstract, meaning any concrete subclasses must implement this method.
