Here's the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from concurrent.futures import Future

class TargetDeletable:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @property
    def delete(self) -> 'Future[None]':
        return self._delete()

    def _delete(self) -> Future[None]:
        # Replace this with your actual deletion logic.
        from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, future
        executor = ThreadPoolExecutor()
        f: Future[None] = executor.submit(lambda: None)
        return f

# Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's interface. 
# Instead, you can use abstract classes or protocols to achieve similar functionality.
```

This code defines an `TargetDeletable` class with a method called `delete`. The `delete` method returns a future which represents the asynchronous deletion operation.
