Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from concurrent.futures import Future

class TargetInterruptible:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def interrupt(self) -> Future[None]:
        # This method should return a future that completes when the interrupt has been sent.
        # For simplicity, we'll just create an immediate-completing future here.
        from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
        executor = ThreadPoolExecutor()
        f = executor.submit(lambda: None)
        return f

# Usage example:
interruptible_target = TargetInterruptible()

future = interruptible_target.interrupt()

try:
    result = future.result()  # Wait for the interrupt to complete.
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while waiting for the interrupt: {e}")
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `CompletableFuture` and `@DebuggerTargetObjectIface`. The above code is a simple translation, it doesn't exactly replicate the functionality provided by these classes in Java.
