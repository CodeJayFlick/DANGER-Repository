Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from concurrent.futures import Future

class TargetResumable:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def resume(self) -> Future[None]:
        # implement your logic here to handle resuming a target
        return Future(None)
```

Note that the Java code is defining an interface `TargetResumable` which extends another interface `DebuggerTargetObjectIface`. In Python, we don't have direct equivalent of interfaces. Instead, we define classes and use abstract methods (methods declared with `@abstractmethod`) to achieve similar functionality.

In this translation, I've defined a class `TargetResumable` that has an abstract method `resume()`, which is the equivalent of Java's interface method declaration. The return type of `resume()` is `Future[None]`, where `Future` is from Python's concurrent.futures module and represents a future (a value that may not be available yet) with no specific result.

The actual implementation of the `resume()` method would depend on your use case, but in this example, it simply returns an instance of `Future[None]`.
