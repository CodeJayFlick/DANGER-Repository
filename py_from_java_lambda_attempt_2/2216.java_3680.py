Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from typing import Collection, Any

class TargetSymbolNamespace:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @property
    def symbols(self) -> "Collection[TargetSymbol]":
        # This method should be implemented in a subclass.
        return self._get_symbols()

    def _get_symbols(self) -> "Collection[TargetSymbol]":
        raise NotImplementedError("Method getSymbols must be overridden")

class TargetSymbol:
    pass

# You can use the following code to create an instance of TargetSymbolNamespace
ns = TargetSymbolNamespace()
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent for Java's CompletableFuture. The above implementation is a simple placeholder and you would need to implement your own asynchronous programming mechanism using libraries like asyncio or concurrent.futures in Python.

Also, the DebugModelConventions class has been removed as it seems specific to Ghidra (a reverse engineering software) and its usage might not be directly applicable in this translation.
