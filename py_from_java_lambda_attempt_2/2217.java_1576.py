Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Define a class that represents a thread in a process.
class TargetThread:
    TID_ATTRIBUTE_NAME = "tid"

    def get_tid(self):
        # This method retrieves an attribute named 'tid' from this object and returns its value as an integer.
        return self.get_typed_attribute_now_by_name(TID_ATTRIBUTE_NAME, int)

# Define the interface for a target execution stateful object. 
class TargetExecutionStateful:
    pass

# Define the interface for a debugger target object.
class DebuggerTargetObjectIface:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

Please note that Python does not support interfaces like Java. Instead, we define classes and methods to achieve similar functionality.
