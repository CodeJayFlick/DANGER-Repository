Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class TestTargetStackFrame:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def set_from_frame(self, that: 'TestTargetStackFrame'):
        pass
```

Note that in this translation, I have used a class `TestTargetStackFrame` to represent the interface. The method `setFromFrame` is translated into Python as `set_from_frame`.
