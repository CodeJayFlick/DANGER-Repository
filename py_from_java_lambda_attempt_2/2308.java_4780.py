Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class ElementsChangedListener:
    class ElementsChangedInvocation:
        def __init__(self, parent: 'TargetObject', removed: list[str], added: dict[str, 'TargetObject']):
            self.parent = parent
            self.removed = removed
            self.added = added

    def elements_changed(self, parent: 'TargetObject', removed: list[str], added: dict[str, 'TargetObject']) -> None:
        invocation = ElementsChangedInvocation(parent, removed, added)
        # record the event here if needed


class TargetObject:
    pass  # This is a placeholder for the actual class definition
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `package`, `import` statements or annotations like `@Override`. Also, in Python, we don't need to specify types explicitly as it has dynamic typing.
