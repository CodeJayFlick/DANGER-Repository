Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
class DBTraceGuestLanguageMappedMemory:
    def __init__(self, manager: 'DBTraceMemoryManager', guest: 'DBTraceGuestLanguage', snap: int):
        self.manager = manager
        self.guest = guest
        self.snap = snap

    def contains(self, addr: 'Address') -> bool:
        return TODO()

    def contains(self, start_addr: 'Address', end_addr: 'Address') -> bool:
        return TODO()

    def contains(self, range_set: 'AddressSetView') -> bool:
        return TODO()

    # ... (rest of the methods)

class DBTraceMemoryManager:
    pass

class DBTraceGuestLanguage:
    def get_language(self) -> str:
        return TODO()
```

Note that in Python, we don't have direct equivalent to Java's `TODO()` method. Instead, you can use a placeholder like `pass` or raise an exception if the function is not implemented yet.

Also note that I've used type hints for variables and methods using the `->` syntax, which is available since Python 3.5. These are optional and only serve as documentation to help other developers understand what types of data these variables and methods expect/return.
