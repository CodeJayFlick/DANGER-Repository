Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DBTraceCodeUnitsMemoryView:
    def __init__(self, manager):
        pass  # Equivalent to super(manager)

    def get_view(self, space):
        return space.code_units

    def get_address_set_view(self, snap, within):
        return AddressSet(within)


# Define a class for address set
class AddressSet(set):
    pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    manager = "DBTraceCodeManager"  # Assuming this is the equivalent Python object
    space = {"code_units": "some_code_units"}  # Assuming this represents DBTraceCodeSpace in Java
    view = DBTraceCodeUnitsMemoryView(manager)
    print(view.get_view(space))
    address_set = view.get_address_set_view(1, (2, 3))  # snap and within are long integers
    print(address_set)
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `AddressSetView` or `DBTraceCodeUnitsMemoryView`. I've replaced them with a simple class called `AddressSet`, which is just an extension of the built-in set type in Python.
