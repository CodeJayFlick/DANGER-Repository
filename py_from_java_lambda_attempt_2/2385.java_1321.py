Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class DBTraceDefinedDataRegisterView(DBTraceDefinedDataView):
    def __init__(self, space: 'DBTraceCodeSpace'):
        super().__init__(space)

    def get_thread(self) -> 'ghidra.trace.model.thread.TraceThread':
        return self.space.get_thread()
```
Note that I've used Python's type hinting system to indicate the types of variables and method parameters. This is not strictly necessary, but it can be helpful for documentation purposes.

Also, since there are no specific requirements or constraints mentioned in the original Java code (e.g., regarding threading, concurrency, etc.), this translation assumes a simple, single-threaded Python program with no special considerations needed.
