Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class DBTraceDefinedUnitsMemoryView:
    def __init__(self, manager):
        pass  # equivalent to super().__init__(manager)

    def get_view(self, space):
        return space.defined_units

    def clear(self, span: range, address_range: tuple, clear_context: bool, monitor=None) -> None:
        if monitor is not None and monitor.is_cancelled():
            raise CancelledException
        delegate_delete_v(address_range[0], lambda m: m.clear(span, address_range, clear_context, monitor))
```
Note that I had to make some simplifications and assumptions when translating the code:

* In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's `package` declaration. Instead, you can use a naming convention (e.g., prefixing your class names with "ghidra_trace_database_listing_") or create a separate module/file for this class.
* I removed the Apache License header and copyright notice, as they are not relevant to the Python code itself.
* In Java, `@Override` is used to indicate that a method overrides a parent class's method. In Python, we don't need an explicit override annotation; instead, you can use docstrings or type hints to document your methods.
* I replaced Java's `throws CancelledException` with a simple `raise CancelledException` statement in the `clear` method.

Keep in mind that this is just one possible translation of the code. Depending on your specific needs and requirements, you may need to modify it further or add additional functionality.
