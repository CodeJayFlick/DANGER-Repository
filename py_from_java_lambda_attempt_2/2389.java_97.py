Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```python
import collections
from typing import Set, Dict

class DBTraceDefinedUnitsView:
    def __init__(self, space):
        self.space = space
        self.parts = [space.instructions, space.defined_data]

    def covers_range(self, span: range, address_range: tuple) -> bool:
        with self._lock_read():
            cur_set = set()
            for part in self.parts:
                cur_set.update(part.subtract_from(span, address_range, cur_set))
            return not cur_set

    def intersects_range(self, span: range, address_range: tuple) -> bool:
        with self._lock_read():
            for part in self.parts:
                if part.intersects_range(span, address_range):
                    return True
            return False

    def clear(self, span: range, address_range: tuple, clear_context: bool, monitor=None):
        for view in self.parts:
            view.clear(span, address_range, clear_context, monitor)

    @property
    def _lock_read(self) -> Dict[str, object]:
        # Implement lock read logic here
        pass

class ImmutableTraceAddressSnapRange:
    def __init__(self, address_range: tuple, span: range):
        self.address_range = address_range
        self.span = span

    @property
    def subtract_from(self, other_span: range, other_address_range: tuple) -> Set[ImmutableTraceAddressSnapRange]:
        # Implement subtraction logic here
        pass

class AbstractBaseDBTraceDefinedUnitsView:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def intersects_range(self, span: range, address_range: tuple) -> bool:
        # Implement intersection logic here
        pass

    def clear(self, span: range, address_range: tuple, clear_context: bool, monitor=None):
        # Implement clearing logic here
        pass

class AbstractDBTraceCodeUnit:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

class DBTraceCodeSpace:
    def __init__(self):
        self.instructions = []
        self.defined_data = []

    @property
    def lock(self) -> Dict[str, object]:
        # Implement lock logic here
        pass
```
Note that I've made some assumptions about the Java code and translated it to Python as best as possible. Some parts of the code may not be directly translatable due to differences in language syntax or semantics.

In particular:

* The `LockHold` class is replaced with a hypothetical `_lock_read()` property, which would need to be implemented separately.
* The `AbstractComposedDBTraceCodeUnitsView` and related classes are simplified to Python classes without equivalent Java counterparts.
* Some method signatures have been adjusted to match Python's syntax and semantics.

Please review the code carefully before using it in your project.
