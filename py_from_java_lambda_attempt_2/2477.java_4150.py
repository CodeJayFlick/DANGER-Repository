Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class DBTraceParameterSymbolView:
    def __init__(self, manager):
        super().__init__(manager, "PARAMETER", manager.parameter_store)

import abc
from ghidra_program_model_symbol import SymbolType
from ghidra_trace_model_symbol import TraceParameterSymbolView

class AbstractDBTraceSymbolSingleTypeWithAddressView(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    @abstractmethod
    def __init__(self, manager, symbol_type_id, store):
        pass

class DBTraceParameterSymbol:
    pass
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the Python code structure and naming conventions. Specifically:

* In Java, `package` statements are not directly translatable to Python. Instead, we can use a simple class definition.
* The `extends` keyword in Java is equivalent to inheritance in Python using the `class` statement with parentheses containing the parent class name.
* The `implements` keyword in Java is equivalent to multiple inheritance in Python by listing the interfaces or classes being implemented after the colon (`:`) in the class definition.

I also had to make some assumptions about the types and variables used in the code, as they were not explicitly defined.
