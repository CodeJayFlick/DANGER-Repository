Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class DBTraceReferenceRegisterSpace:
    def __init__(self, manager, dbh, space, ent, thread):
        super().__init__(manager, dbh, space, ent)
        self.thread = thread
        self.frame_level = ent.get_frame_level()

    @property
    def thread(self):
        return self._thread

    @thread.setter
    def thread(self, value):
        self._thread = value

    @property
    def frame_level(self):
        return self._frame_level

    @frame_level.setter
    def frame_level(self, value):
        self._frame_level = value

class DBTraceReferenceManager:
    pass  # Not implemented in the original Java code, so I left it as a placeholder

# No equivalent to `DBHandle` or other classes in Python (they seem to be specific to GHIDRA)
```
Note that:

* In Python, we don't need explicit getters and setters like we do in Java. Instead, we can use the `@property` decorator to create read-only properties.
* The `super()` call is used to invoke the constructor of the parent class (`DBTraceReferenceSpace`) with the same arguments as before.
* I left out the `VersionException` and `IOException` classes since they are not directly equivalent in Python. If you need to handle these exceptions, you can use Python's built-in exception handling mechanisms (e.g., try-except blocks).
* The `DBHandle`, `AddressSpace`, and other classes seem specific to GHIDRA and don't have direct equivalents in standard Python libraries.
