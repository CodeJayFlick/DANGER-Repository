Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class TraceRegisterContextSpace:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_address_space(self) -> 'AddressSpace':
        return None  # Replace with actual implementation


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class AddressSpace(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def __str__(self):
        pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface. However, we can achieve similar functionality using Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) and abstract methods in Python.

In the above code:

- `TraceRegisterContextSpace` is a class which extends the functionality provided by `TraceRegisterContextOperations`.
- The `get_address_space()` method returns an instance of `AddressSpace`. In this example, it always returns None. You would replace this with your actual implementation.
- `AddressSpace` is another abstract base class that has one abstract method (`__str__`). This means any subclass must implement the `__str__` method.

This Python code does not exactly replicate the Java interface but provides similar functionality using ABCs and abstract methods.
