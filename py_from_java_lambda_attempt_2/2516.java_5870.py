Here is the translation of the Java interface ` TraceLanguageManager` to a Python class:

```Python
class TraceLanguageManager:
    def get_base_language(self):
        # implement this method in your subclass
        pass

    def add_guest_language(self, language):
        # implement this method in your subclass
        pass

    def get_guest_languages(self):
        # implement this method in your subclass
        return []

    def map_guest_instruction_addresses_to_host(self, instruction_set):
        # implement this method in your subclass
        pass
```

Note that the Python code does not have direct equivalents to Java's `package`, `import` statements or interface definitions. Instead, we define a class with methods that match the signature of the original Java interface.

The `pass` statement is used as a placeholder for the implementation of each method in your subclass. You would need to implement these methods according to your specific requirements.
