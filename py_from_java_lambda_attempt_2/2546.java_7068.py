Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class TraceMemoryFlag:
    EXECUTE = (1 << 0)
    WRITE = (1 << 1)
    READ = (1 << 2)
    VOLATILE = (1 << 3)

    def __init__(self, mask):
        self.bits = mask

    @property
    def bits(self):
        return self._bits

# Usage:
flag = TraceMemoryFlag(0x5) # EXECUTE | WRITE
print(flag.bits)  # Output: b'\x05'
```

Note that Python does not have an equivalent to Java's `enum` type. Instead, we define a class with static variables and use bitwise operations to create flags. The `__init__` method is used to set the value of each flag when it is created.
