Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class TraceMemorySpace:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_address_space(self) -> 'AddressSpace':
        # Implement this method as needed for your specific use case.
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def get_code_space(self, create_if_absent: bool = False) -> 'TraceCodeSpace':
        # Implement this method as needed for your specific use case.
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")
```

Note that the Python code does not have direct equivalents to Java's `public` and `extends` keywords. The equivalent of a public interface in Java is simply defining a class without any access modifiers (i.e., just using the keyword `class`).
