Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class TraceProgramViewBookmarkManager:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def get_program(self) -> 'TraceProgramView':
        return None  # This method should be implemented in a subclass or overridden.
```

Note that this is an interface translation, not a direct code conversion. Python does not have built-in support for interfaces like Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we define a class with methods and properties as needed.

The `@Override` annotation is also specific to Java and has no equivalent in Python. In the translated code above, I've removed this annotation since it serves no purpose in Python.
