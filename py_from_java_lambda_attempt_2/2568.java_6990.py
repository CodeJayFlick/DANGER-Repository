Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class TraceProgramViewRegisterListing:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_thread(self) -> 'TraceThread':
        return None  # or any other default value you want to return


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class TraceThread(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def __str__(self):
        pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface. However, we can achieve similar functionality using Abstract Base Classes (ABC) and abstract methods in Python.

In the above code:

- `TraceProgramViewRegisterListing` is a class which inherits from another hypothetical class (`TraceProgramViewListing`) and has one method `get_thread()` that returns an instance of `TraceThread`.
- `TraceThread` is also an Abstract Base Class with one abstract method `__str__()`. This means any subclass of `TraceThread` must implement this method.
