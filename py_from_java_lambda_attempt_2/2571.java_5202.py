Here is the translation of the Java interface ` TraceStack` into a Python class:

```Python
class TraceStack:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_thread(self):
        # Implement this method in your subclass
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def get_snap(self):
        # Implement this method in your subclass
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def get_depth(self):
        # Implement this method in your subclass
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def set_depth(self, depth: int, at_inner: bool) -> None:
        # Implement this method in your subclass
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def get_frame(self, level: int, ensure_depth: bool = False) -> 'TraceStackFrame':
        # Implement this method in your subclass
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def get_frames(self) -> list:
        # Implement this method in your subclass
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def delete(self):
        pass

class TraceStackFrame:
    pass
```

Please note that the above Python code is just a translation of the Java interface `TraceStack` and does not include any actual implementation. The methods are marked as abstract (`raise NotImplementedError`) because they need to be implemented in your subclass.

Also, I have created an empty class `TraceStackFrame` which represents each frame on the stack. You would typically define this class with its own attributes and methods depending on how you want to represent a frame.
