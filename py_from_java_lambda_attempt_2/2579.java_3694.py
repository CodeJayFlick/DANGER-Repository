Here is the translation of the Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class TraceEquateReference:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_lifespan(self) -> range:
        # implement this method in your subclass
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def get_thread(self) -> object:  # assuming Thread is a Python class or type
        # implement this method in your subclass
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def get_varnode(self) -> object:  # assuming Varnode is a Python class or type
        # implement this method in your subclass
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def delete(self):
        pass  # you might want to add some implementation here

# Example of how you could use this class:
class MyTraceEquateReference(TraceEquateReference):
    def __init__(self, lifespan: range, thread: object, varnode: object):
        self.lifespan = lifespan
        self.thread = thread
        self.varnode = varnode

    def get_lifespan(self) -> range:
        return self.lifespan

    def get_thread(self) -> object:
        return self.thread

    def get_varnode(self) -> object:
        return self.varnode

    def delete(self):
        # implement the deletion logic here
        pass
```

This Python class `TraceEquateReference` is an abstract base class (ABC), meaning it cannot be instantiated directly. It provides a blueprint for other classes to follow, and any subclass of this ABC must provide implementations for all its methods except `__init__`.
