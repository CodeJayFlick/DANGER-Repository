Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class TraceEquateSpace:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_address_space(self) -> 'AddressSpace':
        return None  # Replace with actual implementation


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class AddressSpace(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def __str__(self):
        pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface. Instead, we can use Abstract Base Classes (ABC) to define an abstract class and then create concrete classes by inheriting from it.

Also note that the `get_address_space` method in the original code is a part of the `TraceEquateOperations` interface which has been omitted here as there seems no direct equivalent in Python.
