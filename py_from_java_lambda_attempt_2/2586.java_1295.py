Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

class TraceLabelSymbol:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_code_unit(self) -> 'TraceCodeUnit':
        return None  # TODO: implement this method
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's interfaces, classes and methods. In the above translation:

- The `package` declaration is removed as it has no equivalent in Python.
- The `import` statements are also removed because they serve a different purpose than what we would typically do with imports in Python (i.e., importing specific modules or functions).
- The Java interface `TraceLabelSymbol extends TraceSymbolWithLifespan` becomes a simple class definition.
