Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class TraceReferenceSpace:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_address_space(self) -> 'AddressSpace':
        return None  # Replace with actual implementation


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class AddressSpace(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def __str__(self):
        pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we define a class and use the concept of Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) to achieve similar functionality.

In this translation:

- The `get_address_space()` method is translated into a getter method in Python.
- The return type hinting (`AddressSpace`) is used for better code readability and static analysis tools.
