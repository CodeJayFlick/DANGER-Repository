Here's a translation of the Java interface into equivalent Python:

```Python
class TraceableObject:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_object_key(self) -> str:
        # You would need to implement this method in your subclass.
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")
```

This is an abstract class, which means it can't be instantiated directly. It has one method `get_object_key` that needs to be implemented by any concrete subclasses of `TraceableObject`.
