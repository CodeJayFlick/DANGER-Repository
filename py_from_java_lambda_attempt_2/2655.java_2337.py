Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import unittest

class DBTraceRegisterContextManagerTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_something(self):
        pass  # TODO: implement this method


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's `@Ignore` annotation. Instead, you can use the `skipIf` or `skipUnless` methods provided by the `unittest` module to skip test cases under certain conditions.

Also note that I've replaced the `TODO()` call with a simple `pass` statement in Python, as there is no direct equivalent of Java's TODO() method.
