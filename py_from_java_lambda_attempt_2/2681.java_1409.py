Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import unittest

class LanguageTestWatcher(unittest.TestWatcher):
    def __init__(self, default_language=None):
        self.language = default_language or "TOY64_BE"

    @property
    def language(self):
        return self._language

    def starting(self, description):
        annotation = getattr(description, 'test_language', None)
        if annotation is not None:
            self._language = annotation.value

class TestLanguage:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
Note that I had to make some simplifications and assumptions when translating the code:

* The `@Target` and `@Retention` annotations are not directly translatable to Python, so I omitted them.
* The `TestLanguage` annotation is translated into a simple class with an initializer and a single attribute `value`.
* The `ProgramBuilder._TOY64_BE` constant is replaced with the string `"TOY64_BE"` in the constructor of `LanguageTestWatcher`.

Also, this code assumes that you are using Python's built-in unittest module for testing. If you want to use another testing framework or library, you may need to modify the translation accordingly.
