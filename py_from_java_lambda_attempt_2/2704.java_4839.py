Here is the translation of the Java interface `AnyChangeTreeModelListener` to a Python class:

```python
class AnyChangeTreeModelListener:
    def tree_changed(self, e):
        pass  # implement your logic here

    def tree_nodes_changed(self, e):
        self.tree_changed(e)

    def tree_nodes_inserted(self, e):
        self.tree_changed(e)

    def tree_nodes_removed(self, e):
        self.tree_changed(e)

    def tree_structure_changed(self, e):
        self.tree_changed(e)
```

Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's interface. Instead, we define a class with methods that match the signature of the original interface. The `tree_changed` method is left as an abstract implementation (i.e., it does nothing), and you would need to implement your own logic there.

Also, I've kept the same naming convention for the methods as in the Java code, but Python's conventions are slightly different. In particular, we use underscores instead of camelCase for variable names.
