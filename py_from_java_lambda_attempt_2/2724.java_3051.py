Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import typing as t

class HelpInfo(t.Protocol):
    def __call__(self) -> t.Tuple[str]:
        ...

HelpInfo.__annotations__ = {
    "__init_subclass__": lambda cls: setattr(cls, "topic", property(lambda self: [""], setter=lambda s, v: None)),
}

def help_info(topic: str = "", anchor: str = ""):
    return {"topic": topic, "anchor": anchor}
```
Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `@interface` syntax. Instead, we define a protocol (a type hinting mechanism) using the `typing.Protocol` class.

The `help_info` function is defined as a simple dictionary with default values for its arguments. This can be used as a replacement for the Java interface method that returns an array of strings and has two attributes: `topic` and `anchor`.
