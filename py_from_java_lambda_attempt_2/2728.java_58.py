Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import typing as t

class AutoServiceConsumed(t.Protocol):
    pass
```

Note that this Python code does not exactly replicate the original Java annotation. The `@interface` keyword in Java indicates a new interface declaration, which has no direct equivalent in Python. In Python, we can use type hints and protocols to achieve similar functionality.

The `@Target({ ElementType.FIELD, ElementType.METHOD })` directive is used to specify that this annotation can be applied to fields or methods. This concept does not exist directly in Python; however, you could create a custom decorator function to enforce the same behavior:

```Python
def auto_service_consumed(func):
    return func

@auto_service_consumed
class AutoServiceConsumed:
    pass
```

The `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)` directive specifies that this annotation should be retained at runtime. This concept does not exist directly in Python; however, you could create a custom decorator function to enforce the same behavior:

```Python
def retain_at_runtime(func):
    return func

class AutoServiceConsumed:
    pass
```

In summary, while there is no direct equivalent for Java annotations in Python, we can use type hints and protocols or custom decorators to achieve similar functionality.
