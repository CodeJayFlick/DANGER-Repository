Here is the equivalent Python code:

import typing

class Internal:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

Internal = type('Internal', (), {'__module__': 'ghidra.lifecycle'})
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's annotations. The above code defines an `Internal` class, which is essentially the same as the original annotation in Java.
