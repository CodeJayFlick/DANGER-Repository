Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class SleighExpression:
    RESULT_NAME = "___result"

    class ValueCapturingSleighUseropLibrary(metaclass=type):
        def __init__(self):
            self.result = None

        @property
        def result(self):
            return self._result

        @result.setter
        def result(self, value):
            self._result = value

class SleighExpression:
    def __init__(self, language, code, userop_symbols):
        pass  # equivalent to super().__init__()

    def evaluate(self, executor):
        library = ValueCapturingSleighUseropLibrary()
        execute(executor, library)
        return library.result
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's static methods and classes. The above code is a translation of the provided Java code into equivalent Python syntax.

Also, please note that there are some differences in how you would structure your program in Python compared to Java. For example, Python uses indentation instead of brackets to define blocks of code, it does not have an explicit `main` method or static methods like Java has.
