Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class JarUtil:
    @staticmethod
    def get_version():
        return "2.0"
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `package` statement, so I omitted it. Also, in Python, we use the `@staticmethod` decorator to define static methods, whereas in Java you would declare them as `public static`.
