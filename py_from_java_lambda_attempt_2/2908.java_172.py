Here's a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class SampleGraphPluginDependencyLayoutProvider:
    NAME = "Plugin Dependency Layout"
    DEFAULT_ICON = None  # Assuming you have an icon loaded elsewhere in your program.

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_layout(self, g: 'SampleGraph', monitor=None) -> 'VisualGraphLayout':
        layout = SampleGraphPluginDependencyLayout(g, self.NAME)
        self.init_vertex_locations(g, layout)
        return layout

    def get_layout_name(self) -> str:
        return self.NAME

    def get_action_icon(self) -> 'Icon':
        return self.DEFAULT_ICON


class VisualGraphLayout:
    pass  # Assuming this is a custom class in your Python program.


class SampleVertex:
    pass  # Assuming this is a custom class in your Python program.


class SampleEdge:
    pass  # Assuming this is a custom class in your Python program.


class SampleGraph:
    pass  # Assuming this is a custom class in your Python program.
```

Please note that the equivalent classes and methods are not exact translations. They're more like conceptual representations of what you would need to create if you were writing this code from scratch in Python.

In particular, there's no direct translation for Java's `Icon` or `TaskMonitor`, as these seem to be specific to Swing GUI programming which is different from standard Python programming.
