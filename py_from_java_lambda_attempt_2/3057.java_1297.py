Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
import os

class ImportProgramScript:
    def run(self):
        file_path = input("Please specify a file to import: ")
        
        try:
            program = self.import_file(file_path)
            
            if not program:
                language = self.get_default_language('x86')
                
                if not language:
                    print(f"Unable to locate default language for x86")
                    return
                
                compiler_spec = language.default_compiler_spec
                program = self.import_file_as_binary(file_path, language, compiler_spec)
        
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
            return
        
        if not program:
            print(f"Unable to import program from file {file_path}")
            return
        
        self.open_program(program)

    def ask_file(self, prompt, title):
        # This is a placeholder for the equivalent of Java's JFileChooser
        pass

    def import_file(self, file_path):
        # This function should be implemented based on your specific requirements
        pass

    def get_default_language(self, processor_name):
        # This function should be implemented based on your specific requirements
        pass

    def open_program(self, program):
        # This function should be implemented based on your specific requirements
        pass

    def import_file_as_binary(self, file_path, language, compiler_spec):
        # This function should be implemented based on your specific requirements
        pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    script = ImportProgramScript()
    try:
        script.run()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

Please note that this Python code is not a direct translation of the Java code. It's more like an equivalent implementation in Python, with some parts left unimplemented (marked as `pass`). You'll need to fill those functions based on your specific requirements and use cases.
