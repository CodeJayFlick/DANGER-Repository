class AppleSingleDoubleAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(AppleSingleDoubleAnalysisCommand())

class AppleSingleDoubleAnalysisCommand:
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    analyzer = AppleSingleDoubleAnalyzer()
```
Note that I did not translate the Java package and import statements, as they are specific to the Java ecosystem. In Python, we do not need explicit packages or imports for simple classes like this one.
