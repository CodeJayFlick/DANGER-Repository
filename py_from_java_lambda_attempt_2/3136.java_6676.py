Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class CoffArchiveAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(CoffArchiveBinaryAnalysisCommand())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass  # This is just a placeholder, you can add your main logic here if needed.
```
Note that I did not include any imports or class definitions for `AbstractBinaryFormatAnalyzer` and `CoffArchiveBinaryAnalysisCommand`, as they are specific to the Java world and do not have direct equivalents in Python. If these classes exist elsewhere in your codebase, you would need to import them accordingly.

Also, keep in mind that this is a translation of the original Java code, but it may not be equivalent in terms of functionality or behavior.
