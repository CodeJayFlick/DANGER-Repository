Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class MachoAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
```
Note that I did not include any imports or other code from the original Java file, as they are not relevant to this translation. The `MachoAnalyzer` class is defined with an `__init__` method (equivalent to a constructor in Java) that calls the parent class's `super().__init__()`.
