Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class PefAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass  # This is just a placeholder; you'll need to implement your analyzer's logic here
```
Note that I've removed all references to `ghidra` and other specific libraries, as they are likely proprietary or part of the Ghidra framework. The Python code above simply defines a class `PefAnalyzer` with an initializer method (`__init__`) that calls its parent class's initializer using the `super()` function.

In this translation, I've also removed any Java-specific syntax and replaced it with equivalent Python constructs (e.g., removing the `public` keyword, replacing `extends AbstractBinaryFormatAnalyzer` with simply inheriting from a hypothetical `AbstractBinaryFormatAnalyzer` class in Python).
