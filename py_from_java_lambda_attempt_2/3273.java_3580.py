Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class ProgramActionContext:
    def __init__(self, provider, program):
        self._program = program

    def __init__(self, provider, program, source_component=None):
        super().__init__(provider)
        if source_component is None:
            import tkinter as tk
            root = tk.Tk()
            set_source_object(root.focus_get())
        else:
            set_source_object(source_component)

    @property
    def program(self):
        return self._program

class ProgramActionContextProvider:
    pass  # not implemented in the original Java code, but needed for Python's super() call
```
Note that I had to introduce a new class `ProgramActionContextProvider` to satisfy the `super()` call in the constructor. This is because Python does not have an equivalent concept to Java's anonymous inner classes.

Also, I used the `tkinter` library (which is part of the standard Python library) to simulate the behavior of getting the focus owner from a keyboard focus manager, as there is no direct equivalent in Python.
