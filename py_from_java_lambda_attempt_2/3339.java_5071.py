Here's your Java code translated into Python:

```Python
class UserDefinedPropertyPanel:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def __init__(self, is_double_buffered=False):
        super().__init__(is_double_buffered)
```

Note that I've removed the `serialVersionUID` as it's not necessary in Python. Also, since there are no Java-specific features like classes or methods used here (like static variables), this translation should be straightforward and accurate.
