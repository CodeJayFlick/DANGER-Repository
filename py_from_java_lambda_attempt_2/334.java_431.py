I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided code is not a programming language instruction or algorithm, but rather:

1. A license agreement (Apache License 2.0) - This is a legal document outlining the terms of use for software.
2. Package declaration (Java package statement) - This is specific to Java and indicates the namespace for a set of related classes.

As such, there is no Python code to translate from this input. If you meant to provide actual programming instructions or algorithms in another language that you'd like me to convert to Python, please feel free to share those!
