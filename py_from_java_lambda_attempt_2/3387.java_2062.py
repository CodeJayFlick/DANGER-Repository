Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class AnalysisOptionsEditor:
    def __init__(self, program):
        self.program = program

    def dispose(self):
        # stub
        pass

    def apply(self) -> None:
        self.panel.apply_changes()

    def cancel(self):
        # don't care
        pass

    def reload(self):
        # this component doesn't respond to reloads
        pass

    def get_editor_component(self, options: dict, editor_state_factory: callable) -> JComponent:
        self.panel = AnalysisPanel(self.program, editor_state_factory, self)
        return self.panel

    def set_options_property_change_listener(self, listener):
        self.listener = listener

    def property_change(self, event: PropertyChangeEvent) -> None:
        if self.listener is not None:
            self.listener.property_change(event)

class JComponent:
    pass  # equivalent to Java's JComponent class

class AnalysisPanel:
    def __init__(self, program, editor_state_factory, options_editor):
        self.program = program
        self.editor_state_factory = editor_state_factory
        self.options_editor = options_editor

    def apply_changes(self) -> None:
        pass  # equivalent to Java's panel.applyChanges() method

class PropertyChangeListener:
    def property_change(self, event: PropertyChangeEvent) -> None:
        pass  # equivalent to Java's PropertyChangeListener interface

class Program:
    pass  # equivalent to Java's ghidra.program.model.listing.Program class
```
Note that I've used the `->` syntax for method return types and variable annotations, which is a Python convention. Additionally, I've replaced the Java-specific classes (e.g., `JComponent`, `PropertyChangeListener`) with equivalent placeholder classes in Python.

Please note that this translation may not be perfect, as some details might have been lost during the conversion process.
