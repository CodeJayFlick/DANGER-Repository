class AnalysisState:
    """Marker interface for program-specific state information held by AnalysisStateInfo"""
    pass

```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interfaces. Instead, we can use abstract classes or just a regular class with no methods to achieve similar functionality. In this case, I used the `pass` statement in the class definition which is a placeholder and doesn't do anything when an instance of the class is created.
