class TraceViewHtmlExporter:
    def can_export_domain_object(self, domain_object_class):
        return issubclass(domain_object_class, Trace)

import ghidra  # assuming this is a Python module that contains the necessary classes
from ghidra.app.util.exporter import HtmlExporter

# Note: In Python, we don't need to specify explicit imports for classes or methods,
# as they are looked up at runtime. However, I've included the `HtmlExporter` import
# here for clarity.
```
Note that this translation assumes that you have a Python module called `ghidra` that contains the necessary classes and modules (e.g., `DomainObject`, `Trace`). You may need to modify the code further depending on how these classes are defined in your specific use case.
