Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class FindReferencesTableModel:
    def __init__(self, from_addr: 'Address', provider=None, prog=None):
        self.from_addr = from_addr
        if provider and prog:
            super().__init__(from_addr.__str__(), provider, prog)

    def set_alignment(self, alignment):
        pass  # equivalent to Java's setAlignment

class ReferenceFromAddressTableColumn:
    pass  # equivalent to the abstract class in Java

class ReferenceToAddressTableColumn:
    pass  # equivalent to the abstract class in Java

class ReferenceFromLabelTableColumn:
    pass  # equivalent to the abstract class in Java

class ReferenceFromPreviewTableColumn:
    pass  # equivalent to the abstract class in Java

class ReferenceToPreviewTableColumn:
    pass  # equivalent to the abstract class in Java

def initialize_unaligned_list(self, accumulator: 'Accumulator', monitor=None):
    if not monitor or isinstance(monitor, CancelledException):
        return
    ProgramMemoryUtil.load_direct_reference_list(get_program(), self.alignment, from_addr=self.from_addr,
                                                  address_set=self.address_set, accumulator=accumulator, monitor=monitor)

def get_search_address_set(self) -> 'AddressSetView':
    return self.address_set

def get_address(self) -> 'Address':
    return self.from_addr
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent to Java's classes and interfaces. Also, some methods in the original code are missing as they were not provided in your question.
