Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class Checksum32ChecksumAlgorithm:
    """This class is used for the computation of the basic 32-bit checksum algorithm."""

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
```

Note that this is a direct translation, and does not include any additional functionality or modifications. The `super()` function in Python is equivalent to calling the superclass constructor (`BasicChecksumAlgorithm`), but it requires an argument which specifies the class of the parent (in this case, `BasicChecksumAlgorithm`).
