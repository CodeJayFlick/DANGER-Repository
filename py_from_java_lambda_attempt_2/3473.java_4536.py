Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class Checksum8ChecksumAlgorithm:
    """This class is used for the computation of the basic 8-bit checksum algorithm."""

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
```

Note that this is a direct translation, and does not include any additional functionality or modifications. The `super()` function in Python is used to access the methods of parent classes (in this case, it's assumed that there is a parent class called `BasicChecksumAlgorithm`), but since we don't have information about what those methods are or how they should be implemented, I've left them as-is.
