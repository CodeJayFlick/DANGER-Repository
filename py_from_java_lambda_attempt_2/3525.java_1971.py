Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Truncated Text Listing Hover Plugin for Ghidra Code Browser

class TruncatedTextListingHoverPlugin:
    def __init__(self):
        self.truncated_text_hover_service = None

    def register(self, tool):
        super().__init__()
        self.truncated_text_hover_service = TruncatedTextListingHover(tool)
        # Register the service provided by this plugin
        ListingHoverService.register(self.truncated_text_hover_service)

    def dispose(self):
        if self.truncated_text_hover_service:
            self.truncated_text_hover_service.dispose()
            self.truncated_text_hover_service = None

class TruncatedTextListingHover:
    def __init__(self, tool):
        pass  # This class is not implemented in the original Java code
```

Please note that this translation does not include all classes and methods from the original Java code. The `TruncatedTextListingHover` class has been simplified to a placeholder since its implementation was missing in the provided Java code.

Also, Python's syntax for plugins might be different than what you're used to with Java.
