Here's a translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

class EditorListener:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def closed(self, editor: 'EditorProvider'):
        # implement your logic here when an edit session is ending
        pass


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class EditorProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_editor(self) -> object:
        pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface. However, we can achieve similar functionality using Abstract Base Classes (ABCs). In this code, `EditorListener` is a class and `closed` method is defined within it. The `EditorProvider` is also an abstract base class with one abstract method `get_editor`.
