Here's the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class OriginalCompositeListener:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def original_name_changed(self, new_name: str) -> None:
        """Notification method for name change."""
        # Your code here to handle the name changed event.
        pass

    def original_category_changed(self, new_path: 'CategoryPath') -> None:
        """Notification method for category path change."""
        # Your code here to handle the category path changed event.
        pass

    def original_components_changed(self) -> None:
        """Notification method for components changed."""
        # Your code here to handle the components changed event.
        pass
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's interface. Instead, we define a class with methods having similar names and signatures as in the given Java interface.
