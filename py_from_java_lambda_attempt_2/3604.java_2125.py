Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class StructureEditorOptionManager:
    def show_structure_numbers_in_hex(self) -> bool:
        pass  # abstract method implementation not provided
```
Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's `abstract` keyword. Instead, we define an abstract method by providing a placeholder implementation (in this case, the `pass` statement). This indicates that the method is intended to be implemented by subclasses or concrete instances of the class.

Also note that Python does not require explicit type declarations for variables and function parameters like Java does. The `-> bool` syntax in the method signature is equivalent to Java's return type declaration.
