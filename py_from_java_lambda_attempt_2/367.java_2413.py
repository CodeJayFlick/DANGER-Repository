Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DebuggerObjectsProviderTest:
    def __init__(self):
        self.objects_plugin = None
        self.objects_provider = None
        self.mapping_service = None
        self.code_viewer = None

    def setUp(self):
        # Add plugin and wait for component provider to be ready
        self.objects_plugin = add_plugin(DebuggerObjectsPlugin)
        self.objects_provider = waitFor_component_provider(DebuggerObjectsProvider)

        # Get services from tool
        self.mapping_service = get_service(tool, DebuggerStaticMappingService)
        self.code_viewer = get_service(tool, CodeViewerService)

    def test_basic(self):
        create_and_open_trace()
        trace_manager.activate_trace(tb.trace)
        try:
            with tb.start_transaction() as tid:
                # objects_provider.import_from_xml_action.run()
                pass
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        
        wait_for_domain_object(tb.trace)

def add_plugin(plugin_class):
    # Implement this function to add a plugin in Python equivalent of Java's addPlugin method.
    pass

def waitFor_component_provider(component_provider_class):
    # Implement this function to wait for component provider in Python equivalent of Java's waitForComponentProvider method.
    pass

def get_service(tool, service_class):
    # Implement this function to get services from tool in Python equivalent of Java's getService method.
    pass

def create_and_open_trace():
    # Implement this function to create and open a trace in Python equivalent of Java's createAndOpenTrace method.
    pass

def wait_for_domain_object(trace):
    # Implement this function to wait for domain object in Python equivalent of Java's waitForDomainObject method.
    pass
```

Please note that the above code is not executable as it contains placeholders (`add_plugin`, `waitFor_component_provider`, `get_service`, `create_and_open_trace` and `wait_for_domain_object`) which need to be implemented according to your specific requirements.
