Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk
from threading import Thread

class DataTypesTreeCellEditor:
    def __init__(self, treeview, renderer):
        self.tree = treeview
        self.renderer = renderer
        self.plugin = None
        self.last_edited_node = None

    def get_tree_cell_editor_component(self, value, selected, expanded, leaf, row):
        if isinstance(value, GTreeNode) and value.has_custom_editor():
            Thread(target=self.edit, args=(value,)).start()
            return self.renderer.get_tree_cell_renderer_component(
                self.tree,
                value,
                selected,
                expanded,
                leaf,
                row
            )
        else:
            self.last_edited_node = value.parent
            return super().get_tree_cell_editor_component(self.tree, value, selected, expanded, leaf, row)

    def edit(self, node):
        if isinstance(node, GTreeNode) and node.is_modifiable():
            dt = node.data_type
            self.plugin.get_editor_manager().edit(dt)
```

Note that this translation is not a direct conversion from Java to Python. It's more of an equivalent implementation in Python.

Here are some key differences:

1. In the original code, `JTree` and related classes were used for GUI operations. Tkinter (Python) does not have exact equivalents for these classes. Instead, we use `ttk.Treeview` which is a tree widget that can be used to create hierarchical data structures.

2. The Java code uses SwingUtilities.invokeLater() method to perform long-running tasks in the background and avoid blocking the GUI thread. In Python, this functionality is achieved using threading.Thread().
