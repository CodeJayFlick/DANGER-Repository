Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import tkinter as tk

class VarnodeLocationTableCellRenderer:
    def get_table_cell_renderer_component(self, data):
        label = super().get_table_cell_renderer_component(data)
        value = data.get_value()
        
        if isinstance(value, int):  # equivalent to "value instanceof Address"
            address = value
            if address >= 0:  # equivalent to "address.isStackAddress()"
                label.config(text=hex(address)[2:])  # equivalent to NumericUtilities.toSignedHexString(address.getOffset())
            else:
                label.config(text=f"-{int(abs(address))}" + hex(int(abs(address)))[2:])
        return label

# Note: In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's `JLabel` or `GTableCellRenderer`. We're using the built-in `tkinter` library to create a simple GUI component.
```
Note that I've made some simplifications and assumptions in translating the code:

* The `Address` class is not directly translatable, so I assumed it was an integer value representing a memory address. If this assumption is incorrect, please let me know!
* The `NumericUtilities.toSignedHexString(address.getOffset())` method call has been replaced with a simple conversion to hexadecimal using Python's built-in `hex()` function.
* The GUI component used in the original Java code (a `JLabel`) has been replaced with a basic Tkinter label, as there is no direct equivalent of this class in Python.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns!
