Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class FunctionComparisonModelListener:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def model_changed(self, model: list) -> None:
        """Invoked when the comparison model has changed"""
        # Your implementation here
        pass


# No direct translation for "package" statement in Java. It's not needed in Python.
```

Note that this is a simple translation and does not include any error handling or additional functionality that might be present in the original Java code.
