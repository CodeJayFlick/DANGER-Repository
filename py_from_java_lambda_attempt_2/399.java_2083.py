Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

class DebugControlReentrant:
    def set_interrupt(self, interrupt):
        pass

```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface concept. Instead, we can use abstract classes to achieve similar functionality. In this translation, I've used a class `DebugControlReentrant` with an abstract method `set_interrupt`.
