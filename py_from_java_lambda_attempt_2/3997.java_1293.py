import abc

class InterpreterPanelService:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def create_interpreter_panel(self, interpreter: 'InterpreterConnection', visible: bool) -> 'InterpreterConsole':
        """Creates a new interpreter panel.
        
        Args:
            interpreter (InterpreterConnection): A connection back to the interpreter.
            visible (bool): True if the panel should be visible when created; otherwise, false.

        Returns:
            InterpreterConsole: The interpreter console that corresponds to the panel.
        """
        pass

class ServiceInfo:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```
Note:

* I did not include any implementation for `create_interpreter_panel` method as it is an abstract method and should be implemented by its concrete subclass.
* In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent of Java's `@ServiceInfo` annotation. Instead, we can use the `abc` module to define an abstract base class (ABC) that has an abstract method.
* I also did not include any implementation for `InterpreterConnection`, `InterpreterConsole` classes as they are not provided in the original code snippet.

Please note that this is a direct translation of Java code to Python, and it may require further modifications or adjustments based on your specific use case.
