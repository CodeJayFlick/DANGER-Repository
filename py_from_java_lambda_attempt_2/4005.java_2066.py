Here is the translation of the Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class LabelHistoryListener:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def address_selected(self, program: 'Program', addr: 'Address'):
        # Add your code here to handle the selected address event.
        pass


# Note that we don't have direct equivalent of Java's interface in Python,
# so I used a class with methods instead.
