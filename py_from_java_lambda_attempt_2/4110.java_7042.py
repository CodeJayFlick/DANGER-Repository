Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import os

class GhidraBundleActivator:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def start(self, bundle_context: object, api: object) -> None:
        # implementation goes here
        pass

    def stop(self, bundle_context: object, api: object) -> None:
        # implementation goes here
        pass

def main():
    ghidra_bundle_activator = GhidraBundleActivator()
    # usage of the class goes here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Note that I did not translate the Java-specific OSGi-related code, as it is specific to the Eclipse ecosystem and does not have a direct equivalent in Python. The `GhidraBundleActivator` class itself has been translated to Python using standard syntax.

Also, please note that this translation assumes you are familiar with both Java and Python programming languages.
