Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import threading

class DbgEngClientThreadExecutor:
    def __init__(self, make_client):
        self.make_client = make_client
        self.manager = None

    @property
    def manager(self):
        return self.manager

    @manager.setter
    def manager(self, value):
        self.manager = value

    def start(self):
        threading.Thread(target=self.run).start()

    def run(self):
        client = self.make_client()
        # equivalent to init() method in Java
        pass  # todo: implement the rest of the code here

# usage example:
make_client = lambda: DebugClient()  # replace with your implementation
executor = DbgEngClientThreadExecutor(make_client)
executor.start()

class DebugClient:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # todo: implement the client logic here

DbgManager = object  # equivalent to Java class, no implementation needed for now
```
Note that I've used Python's `@property` decorator to create a getter and setter for the `manager` attribute. This is similar to how you would define getters and setters in Java using accessors.

I also created an empty `DebugClient` class as a placeholder, since there was no implementation provided in the original code. You'll need to fill this out with your own logic.

Finally, I used Python's built-in `threading` module to create a thread that runs the `run()` method when started. This is equivalent to starting a new thread in Java using `start()`.
