Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DebugAdvancedImpl1:
    def __init__(self, jna_advanced):
        self.cleanable = None  # Equivalent to OpaqueCleanable in Java
        self.jna_advanced = jna_advanced

    def get_thread_basic_information(self, tid):
        raise NotImplementedError("Not supported by this interface")
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for some of the Java constructs used here. For example:

- The `@SuppressWarnings` annotation is a compiler-level warning suppression mechanism in Java and has no direct equivalent in Python.
- The `private final OpaqueCleanable cleanable;` declaration can be replaced with simply defining an instance variable (`self.cleanable`) without any access modifiers, as there are none in Python.
