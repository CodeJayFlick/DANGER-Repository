Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DebugAdvancedImpl3(DebugAdvancedImpl2):
    def __init__(self, jna_advanced):
        super().__init__(jna_advanced)
        self.jna_advanced = jna_advanced
```

Note that this is a direct translation from Java to Python. The `@SuppressWarnings("unused")` annotation in the original code has no equivalent in Python and was simply ignored.
