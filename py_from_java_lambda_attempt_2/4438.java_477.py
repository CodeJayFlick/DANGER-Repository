Here is a translation of the provided Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class EventDisplayPlugin:
    def __init__(self):
        self.provider = None  # Initialize provider as None for now.

    def start(self):  # This method will be called when plugin starts.
        pass  # You can put your startup logic here, if needed.

    def stop(self):  # This method will be called when the plugin stops.
        pass  # You can put any cleanup code here, if needed.

class EventDisplayComponentProvider:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Event Display Plugin"  # Set your provider name here

    def process_event(self, event):  # This method will be called when a plugin event occurs.
        pass  # You can put the code to handle this event here.

# Create an instance of EventDisplayPlugin
plugin = EventDisplayPlugin()

def main():
    print("Event Display Plugin is running.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `@PluginInfo`, `@formatter:off` and `@formatter:on`. These are annotations used in the provided Java code to provide metadata about the plugin.
