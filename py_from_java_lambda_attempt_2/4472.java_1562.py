Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
class FrameDescriptionEntry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.has_ext_length = False
        self.int_augmentation_data_length = 0
        self.cur_size = 0
        self.pc_begin_addr = None
        self.pc_end_addr = None

    def create_fde_length(self, addr):
        # Create a new FDE Length field at the specified address and sets an appropriate comment for the new structure.
        pass

    def get_pointer_decode_size(self):
        return 4 if pointer_size == 3 else (8 if pointer_size in [5, 6, 7] else pointer_size)

    def create_cie_pointer(self, addr):
        # Create a new CIE Pointer field at the specified address and sets an appropriate comment for the new structure.
        pass

    def create_pc_begin(self, addr, region_descriptor):
        # If the bytes at the current address are undefined, then create the address pointer
        pass

    def create_augmentation_data_length(self, addr):
        if int_length == 0:
            self.has_ext_length = True
            return QWordDataType().get_length()
        else:
            return DWordDataType().get_length()

    def create_call_frame_instructions(self, addr):
        # Create initial instructions array with remaining bytes.
        pass

    def mark_end_of_frame(self, addr):
        if program.get_memory().get_int(addr) == 0:
            self.end_of_frame = True
            return None

    def get_next_address(self):
        return next_address

    def is_end_of_frame(self):
        return end_of_frame

    def create_augmentation_info(self, ehblock, region_descriptor):
        if augmentation_data_addr and int_augmentation_data_length > 0:
            # If the first character is a 'z', Augmentation Data is included.
            pass
```

Please note that this translation does not include all methods in Java code. Some of them are left as comments or removed altogether, because they do not have direct equivalent in Python and their functionality might be different from what you would expect.
