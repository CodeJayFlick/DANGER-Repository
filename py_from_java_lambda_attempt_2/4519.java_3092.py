Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class StringTransformer:
    def __call__(self, s: str) -> any:
        pass  # This method should be implemented by subclasses.
```

Note that in this translation, I have used a class `StringTransformer` instead of an interface. In Python, there is no direct equivalent to Java's interfaces or abstract classes with methods. Instead, you can use abstract base classes (ABCs) from the built-in module `abc`, but it would be overkill for such a simple case.

Also note that I have used type hints (`str` and `any`) which are not enforced at runtime in Python, unlike Java where they would throw an error if not respected.
