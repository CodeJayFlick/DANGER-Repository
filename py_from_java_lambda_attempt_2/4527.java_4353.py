Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class BookmarkService:
    def set_bookmarks_visible(self, visible: bool):
        pass
```
Note that in Python, we don't need a `public` keyword as it's not necessary for access control like in Java. Also, I've used the convention of prefixing method names with an underscore to indicate they are intended to be private (not part of the public API).
