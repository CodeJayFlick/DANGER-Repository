Here's the translation of the given Java interface into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MemorySearchService:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    # sets up MemSearchDialog based on given bytes
    def search(self, bytes: bytearray, context) -> None:
        pass  # implement this method as needed

    # sets the search value field to the masked bit string
    def set_search_text(self, masked_string: str) -> None:
        pass  # implement this method as needed

    # determines whether the dialog was called by a mnemonic or not
    def setIsMnemonic(self, is_mnemonic: bool) -> None:
        pass  # implement this method as needed
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's interfaces and classes. Instead, we define a class `MemorySearchService` with methods corresponding to the interface in Java. The methods are defined without any implementation (i.e., they do nothing) since you would need to provide your own logic based on how these methods should behave in Python.
