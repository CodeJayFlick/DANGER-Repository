Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class ViewService:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    # Add a view that corresponds to the given program location.
    def add_to_view(self, loc: 'ProgramLocation') -> 'AddressSetView':
        return AddressSetView()

    # Get the current view.
    def get_current_view(self) -> 'AddressSetView':
        return AddressSetView()
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface concept. However, we can achieve similar functionality using abstract classes or protocols in Python.

In this translation:

- The `public` access modifier is removed as it has no effect on the code.
- The comment blocks are preserved for clarity and documentation purposes.
- The method return types (`AddressSetView`) are kept consistent with Java's original type declaration.
