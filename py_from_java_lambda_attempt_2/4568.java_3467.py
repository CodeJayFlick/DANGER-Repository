Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AddressableRowObject:
    def get_address(self):
        pass
```

Note that in this translation, I have used a class instead of an interface as interfaces are not supported directly in Python. Also, since we don't know what kind of object `AddressableRowObject` should be (e.g., it could be a simple integer or some complex data structure), the above code assumes that any instance of `AddressableRowObject` would have to implement this method.

If you want to make sure that only instances of certain classes can be used as `AddressableRowObject`, you might need to use abstract base classes (ABCs) and possibly protocols.
