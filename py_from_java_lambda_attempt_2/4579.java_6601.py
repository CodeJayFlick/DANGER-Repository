class AddressFactoryService:

```

Note that in Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we define a class with abstract methods (i.e., methods without an implementation). The `pass` statement is used as a placeholder for the method body, indicating that it should be implemented by any subclass or instance of this class.
