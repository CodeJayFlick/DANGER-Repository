Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DebugControlInternal(DebugControl):
    CACHE = WeakValueHashMap()

    @classmethod
    def instance_for(cls, control):
        return DbgEngUtil.lazy_weak_cache(CACHE, control)

    # Note: In Python, we don't have direct equivalents of Java's static methods.
    # We can achieve similar functionality using classmethods or regular functions.

    @classmethod
    def try_preferred_interfaces(cls, supplier):
        return DbgEngUtil.try_preferred_interfaces(DebugControlInternal, DebugControlInternal.PREFERRED_CONTROL_IIDS, supplier)

    PREFERRED_CONTROL_IIDS = {}
    for i in range(7):
        if i == 0:
            IID = IDebugControl.IID_IDebug_Control
        elif i == 1:
            IID = IDebugControl2.IID_IDebug_Control2
        elif i == 2:
            IID = IDebugControl3.IID_IDebug_Control3
        elif i == 3:
            IID = IDebugControl4.IID_IDebug_Control4
        elif i == 4:
            IID = IDebugControl5.IID_IDebug_Control5
        elif i == 5:
            IID = IDebugControl6.IID_IDebug_Control6
        else:
            IID = IDebugControl7.IID_IDebug_Control7

        if i > 0:
            PREFERRED_CONTROL_IIDS[IID] = locals()[f'WrapIDebugControl{i}']

    def remove_breakpoint(self, com_bpt):
        pass  # This method is not implemented in the given Java code.
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents of Java's static methods. We can achieve similar functionality using classmethods or regular functions.

Also, this translation assumes that `DbgEngUtil`, `WeakValueHashMap`, and other classes are available in your Python environment. You may need to implement these yourself if they're not already part of a library you're using.
