Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
# AoutHeaderMagic class in Python

class AoutHeaderMagic:
    TIC80_AOUTHDR_MAGIC = 0x108
    TICOFF_AOUTHDR_MAGIC = 0x108
```

Note that there's no equivalent to `public` and `final` keywords in Python. In Python, everything is public by default (there are no access modifiers like private or protected), so we don't need those keywords here.
