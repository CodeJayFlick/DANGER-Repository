Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
# CoffConstants.py

SECTION_NAME_LENGTH = 8
SYMBOL_NAME_LENGTH = 8
SYMBOL_SIZEOF = 18
FILE_NAME_LENGTH = 14
AUXILIARY_ARRAY_DIMENSION = 4

class CoffConstants:
    pass
```
Note that in Python, we don't need to declare variables or methods ahead of time like you do in Java. Instead, we can simply assign values to names and define a class with no methods if needed.

Also, I removed the comments from the original code since they are not necessary in Python (we use `#` for single-line comments). If you want to keep them, you can add backslashes (`\`) at the end of each line to continue the comment on the next line.
