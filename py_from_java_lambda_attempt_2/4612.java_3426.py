Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

```
class CoffFileHeaderTargetID:
    TIC2xx_TARGET_ID = 0x92
    TIC5X_TARGET_ID = 0x92
    TIC80_TARGET_ID = 0x95
    TIC54X_TARGET_ID = 0x98
    TIC64X_TARGET_ID = 0x99
    TIC55X_TARGET_ID = 0x9c
    TIC27X_TARGET_ID = 0x9d

print(CoffFileHeaderTargetID.__dict__)
```

Note that in Python, we don't need to specify the `public` keyword as it is not a reserved word. Also, since there are no methods or constructors defined in this class, I simply translated the Java code into equivalent Python syntax.
