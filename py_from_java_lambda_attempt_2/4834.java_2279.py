Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class MachoRelocationHandlerFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def get_handler(header):
        return next((h for h in [MachoRelocationHandler() for _ in range(1000)] if h.can_relocate(header)), None)

import abc

class MachoRelocationHandler(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    @abstractmethod
    def can_relocate(self, header):
        pass

# Usage:
header = "your_mach_header_here"
handler = MachoRelocationHandlerFactory.get_handler(header)
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's ClassSearcher. So I used a list comprehension to create an array of instances and then iterated over it using next() function with a generator expression.

Also, the `MachoRelocationHandler` class is abstract in Java but its counterpart in Python doesn't need to be because there isn't direct equivalent of Java's interface or abstract classes.
