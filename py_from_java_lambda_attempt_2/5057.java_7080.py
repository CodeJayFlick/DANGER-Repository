Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python code:

```Python
class COMDescriptorDataDirectory:
    NAME = "IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_COM_DESCRIPTOR"

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @classmethod
    def create_com_descriptor_data_directory(cls, nt_header, reader):
        com_descriptor_data_directory = cls()
        com_descriptor_data_directory.init_com_descriptor_data_directory(nt_header, reader)
        return com_descriptor_data_directory

    def init_com_descriptor_data_directory(self, nt_header, reader):
        self.nt_header = nt_header
        self.process_data_directory(nt_header, reader)

    @property
    def header(self):
        return self._header

    @header.setter
    def header(self, value):
        self._header = value

    def process_data_directory(self, nt_header, reader):
        pass  # Not implemented in the original Java code either.

    def get_directory_name(self):
        return self.NAME


class ImageCor20Header:
    @classmethod
    def create_image_cor20_header(cls, reader, ptr, nt_header):
        pass  # This method is not defined in the provided Java code.


def main():
    com_descriptor_data_directory = COMDescriptorDataDirectory.create_com_descriptor_data_directory(nt_header, reader)
```

Please note that this translation assumes you have a basic understanding of Python and its syntax. The original Java code seems to be part of some larger program or framework (Ghidra), so the equivalent Python code may not work exactly as-is without additional context or modifications.

Here are some key differences between the two languages:

1. **Class definition**: In Java, classes are defined using `public class` statements. In Python, you can define a class simply by writing its name followed by parentheses.
2. **Method declaration**: In Java, methods are declared with their return type and parameters in parentheses. In Python, method declarations do not include the return type or parameter types (unless they're explicitly specified).
3. **Property accessors**: Python uses property decorators (`@property` and `@<attribute>.setter`) to implement getter/setter pairs for attributes.
4. **Exception handling**: Java has a more comprehensive exception-handling mechanism than Python, which relies on try-except blocks.

These differences can affect the overall structure and syntax of your code when translating from one language to another.
