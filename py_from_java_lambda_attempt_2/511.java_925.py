Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class WrapIDebugClient6:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __init__(self, pv_instance):
        super().__init__()

    def set_event_context_callbacks(self, callbacks):
        # Assuming _invokeHR and VTIndices6 are defined elsewhere in the codebase.
        return self._invoke_hr(1, pv_instance, callbacks)

class ByReference(WrapIDebugClient6):
    pass

# Assuming com.sun.jna.Pointer and com.sun.jna.Structure are imported from jna library
from jna import Pointer, Structure

class IDebugEventContextCallbacks:
    pass

def _invoke_hr(index, instance, callback):
    # This function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the codebase.
    return 0
```

Note that this translation assumes some functions and classes are already defined elsewhere in your Python code. The original Java code seems to use JNA (Java Native Access) library for interacting with native libraries, but equivalent functionality may not exist in Python's standard library.
