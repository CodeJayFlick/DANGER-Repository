Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class ExportedSymbolHashSlot:
    def __init__(self, reader):
        try:
            count_and_start = int.from_bytes(reader.read(4), 'little')
            self.symbol_count = (count_and_start >> 18)
            self.index_of_first_export_key = count_and_start & 0x12
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")

    def get_symbol_count(self):
        return self.symbol_count

    def get_index_of_first_export_key(self):
        return self.index_of_first_export_key


class BinaryReader:
    def read(self, size):
        # This method should be implemented based on the actual binary reader
        pass


def main():
    try:
        reader = BinaryReader()
        slot = ExportedSymbolHashSlot(reader)
        print(f"Symbol Count: {slot.get_symbol_count()}")
        print(f"Index of First Export Key: {slot.get_index_of_first_export_key()}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note that the `BinaryReader` class is not fully implemented in this translation, and you would need to implement it based on your actual binary reader.
