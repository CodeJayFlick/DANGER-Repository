Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from enum import Enum

class VTIndices6(Enum):
    GET_EXECUTABLE_STATUS_EX = 0
    GET_SYNCHRONIZATION_STATUS = 1


class IDebugControl6:
    IID_IDEBUG_CONTROL6 = "bc0d583f-126d-43a1-9cc4-860ab1d537b"

    def get_execution_status_ex(self, status):
        pass

# Note: The following Python code is not equivalent to the given Java code.
# It's just a simple translation of the interface and enum definitions.

```

Please note that this translation does not include any actual implementation or functionality. In particular:

- `ULONGByReference` in Java corresponds to no direct equivalent in Python, as it seems to be some kind of reference-counted integer type specific to JNA.
- The `HRESULT` return value from the method is also missing a direct equivalent in Python.

This translation only aims at providing an interface and enum definitions similar to those found in the given Java code.
