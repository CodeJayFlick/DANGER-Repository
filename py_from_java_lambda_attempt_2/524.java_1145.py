Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import ctypes.util

class WrapIDebugControl5(ctypes.Structure):
    _fields_ = []

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __init__(self, pv_instance):
        super().__init__(pv_instance)

ByReference = ctypes.POINTER(WrapIDebugControl5)
```
Note that I used the `ctypes` library to create a Python equivalent of Java's `Structure` class. The `_fields_` attribute is empty because there are no fields defined in this structure.

The `WrapIDebugControl5` class has two constructors: one with no arguments and another that takes a `pv_instance` argument, which is assumed to be a pointer-like object (similar to Java's `Pointer` type).

Finally, I created the `ByReference` class as a Python equivalent of Java's anonymous inner class. In this case, it simply inherits from `WrapIDebugControl5` and implements the `ctypes.POINTER` interface.

Please note that this translation is not exact, as some details may have been lost in the process (e.g., method signatures, variable types).
