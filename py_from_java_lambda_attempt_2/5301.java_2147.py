class DomainObjectService:
    """Simple interface for getting a DomainObject. This is used to delay the opening of 
       a domainObject until it is needed."""
    
    def get_domain_object(self):
        pass  # TO DO: implement this method
```

Note that I've kept the Python code as simple and minimalistic as possible, without implementing any actual functionality in the `get_domain_object` method.
