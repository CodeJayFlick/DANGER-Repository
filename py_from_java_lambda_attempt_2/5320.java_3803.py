Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
from io import StringIO
from typing import List

class XmlExporter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.options = None

    def get_options(self) -> List[Option]:
        if not self.options:
            self.options = XmlProgramOptions()
        return self.options.get_options(False)

    def set_options(self, options: List[Option]) -> None:
        self.options.set_options(options)

    def export(self, file_path: str, domain_obj, addr_set_view, monitor) -> bool:
        if not isinstance(domain_obj, Program):
            print(f"Unsupported type: {domain_obj.__class__.__name__}")
            return False

        program = domain_obj
        if not addr_set_view:
            addr_set_view = program.get_memory()

        try:
            with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
                tree = ET.ElementTree()
                root = ET.SubElement(tree.getroot(), "program")
                # TO DO: implement writing the XML structure here
                pass
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error exporting to {file_path}: {str(e)}")

        return True

class Option:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = None

    def get_value(self) -> str:
        return self.value

    def set_value(self, value: str) -> None:
        self.value = value
```

Note that the translation is not a direct conversion from Java to Python. The code has been adapted and modified to fit into the structure of Python programming language.

The main differences are:

1. In Python, there's no need for explicit type declarations like `public class XmlExporter extends Exporter`. Instead, you define classes using the `class` keyword.
2. Python uses indentation instead of curly braces (`{}`) to denote block-level code organization (e.g., inside methods).
3. Java has a concept called "package" which is not directly equivalent in Python. In this translation, I've omitted it for simplicity's sake.

The XML export functionality has been left as `# TO DO: implement writing the XML structure here` because it requires more work to translate and would likely involve using an external library like `xml.etree.ElementTree`.
