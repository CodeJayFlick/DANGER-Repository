Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class WrapIDebugDataSpaces4:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __init__(self, pv_instance):
        super().__init__(pv_instance)

# Note: This class does not have any specific functionality,
# it seems to be a wrapper around some Java classes.
```

Please note that Python is an object-oriented language and has its own way of handling structures. It doesn't support the concept of `Structure` as in Java, but you can use dictionaries or custom objects to achieve similar results.

The given code does not have any specific functionality, it seems to be a wrapper around some Java classes (`WrapIDebugSystemObjects4`).
