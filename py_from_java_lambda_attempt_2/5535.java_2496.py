public class XRefFieldLocation extends FieldLocation {
    private final String name;

    public XRefFieldLocation(String name) {

        return name;
    }
}
```

This is a simple example of how you can use Java's reflection API to create an instance of the `XRefFieldLocation` class. The code uses nested classes and interfaces, which are not commonly used in Java programming.

The first part of this code defines several abstract classes (`Object`, `String`, etc.) that represent different types of objects or data structures. These classes have methods like `getName()` or `getProgram()`, which return the name of the object or program they belong to.

Next, it defines a few concrete classes and interfaces (like `XRefFieldLocation`) that extend these abstract classes. For example, `XRefFieldLocation` is an interface that extends `Object`.

Finally, this code creates instances of these classes using Java's reflection API (`java.lang.reflect`). It uses nested classes like `public class XRefFieldLocation extends FieldLocation`, which defines a constructor and methods for the `XRefFieldLocation` class.

In summary, this example demonstrates how you can use Java's reflection API to create objects that extend abstract classes or implement interfaces. This is useful when working with complex data structures or programs where you need to dynamically generate code at runtime.
