Here is the translation of the Java interface `IDebugOutputCallbacks2` to a Python class:
```python
import ctypes

class IDebugOutputCallbacks2:
    IID_IDEBUG_OUTPUT_CALLBACKS2 = "67721fe9-56d2-4a44-a325-2b65513ce6eb"

    def get_interest_mask(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("GetInterestMask not implemented")

    def output2(self, which: int, flags: int, arg: int, text: str) -> None:
        raise NotImplementedError("Output2 not implemented")
```
Note that I've used the `ctypes` module to represent the Windows-specific types (e.g. `ULONG`, `ULONGLONG`) as Python integers and strings.

Also, since this is an interface definition in Java, I've made the methods abstract by raising a `NotImplementedError`. In Python, you would typically implement these methods concretely if you were using this class to interact with some external API or library.
