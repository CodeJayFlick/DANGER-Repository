Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python equivalent:

```Python
class ListingDiffChangeListener:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def listing_diff_changed(self):
        """Called when the ListingDiff's set of differences and unmatched addresses has changed."""
        pass
```

In this code, we have defined a class `ListingDiffChangeListener` which is equivalent to an interface in Java. The class contains one method `listing_diff_changed()` which corresponds to the single abstract method (SAM) in the original Java interface.
