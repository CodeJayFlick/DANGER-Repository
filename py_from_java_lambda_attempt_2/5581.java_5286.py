Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class MarkerClickedListener:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def marker_double_clicked(self, location: 'MarkerLocation'):
        """Notification that the user double-clicked in the marker margin"""
        # Your code here to handle this event
```

Note that I've used Python's docstring syntax (`"""..."""`) for documenting the method.
