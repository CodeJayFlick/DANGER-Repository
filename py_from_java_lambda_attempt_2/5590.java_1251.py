Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class LayoutCache:
    _max_entries = 500
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
    
def main():
    pass

# Note: The MultiLayout class does not exist in Python, so it's been removed.
```

Here is a brief explanation of the translation process:

1. `package ghidra.app.util.viewer.multilisting;` - This line specifies the package name for Java classes. In Python, we don't have packages at this level (i.e., we can put our class anywhere in the file). So, it's been removed.

2. The imports are not necessary in Python as all built-in types and functions are available by default.

3. `public class LayoutCache extends FixedSizeHashMap<Address, MultiLayout>` - This line defines a Java class named `LayoutCache`. In Python, we can define classes directly without any extensions or inheritance.

4. `_private static final int MAX_ENTRIES = 500;` - This is not necessary in Python as variables are public by default and there's no concept of private variables like in Java.

5. The constructor (`public LayoutCache()`) has been translated into a regular method `__init__(self)` which gets called when an instance of the class is created.

6. `super(MAX_ENTRIES, MAX_ENTRIES);` - This line calls the parent class's constructor with two arguments in Java. In Python, we don't need to do this as classes are not inherited by default (we can use inheritance explicitly if needed).

7. The cache has been translated into a regular dictionary (`self.cache = {}`) which is used for storing key-value pairs.

8. `MultiLayout` class does not exist in Python so it's been removed from the code.
