Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class EmptyProxy:
    EMPTY_PROXY = None

    def __init__(self):
        self.EMPTY_PROXY = EmptyProxy()

    def get_object(self) -> object:
        return None


if __name__ == "__main__":
    proxy = EmptyProxy()
    print(proxy.get_object())
```
Note that I did not include the Java-style comments, as they are not necessary in Python. Also, I used the `->` syntax to indicate the return type of the `get_object()` method, which is a feature introduced in Python 3.5. If you're using an earlier version of Python, you can omit this syntax and simply use the `return None` statement instead.
