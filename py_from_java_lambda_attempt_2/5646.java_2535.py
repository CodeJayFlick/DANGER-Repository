Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class NamespaceColumnTypeMapper:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def convert(self, namespace: str) -> str:
        return namespace
```
Note that I did not include any imports or licensing information in this translation, as these are specific to the original Java code and may not be relevant to a Python implementation.
