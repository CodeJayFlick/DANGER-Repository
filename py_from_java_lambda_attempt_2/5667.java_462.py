Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import io

class GFileSystemFactoryByteProvider(FSTYPE):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def create(self, target_fsrl: 'FSRLRoot', byte_provider: ByteProvider,
               fs_service: 'FileSystemService', monitor: TaskMonitor) -> FSTYPE:
        try:
            # Create a new GFileSystem instance
            g_file_system = self.create_g_file_system(target_fsrl, byte_provider)
            return g_file_system
        except (io.IOException, CancelledException):
            raise

    def create_g_file_system(self, target_fsrl: 'FSRLRoot', byte_provider: ByteProvider) -> FSTYPE:
        # Implement the logic to create a new GFileSystem instance here
        pass

class FSRLRoot:
    pass

class FileSystemService:
    pass

class TaskMonitor:
    pass

# Define the type hint for FSTYPE
FSTYPE = object  # Replace with actual type if known
```
Note that I've used Python's type hints to indicate the expected types of the variables and method parameters. However, since we don't have a specific implementation of `GFileSystem`, `FSRLRoot`, `FileSystemService`, or `TaskMonitor` in this code snippet, I've left those classes as abstract placeholders.

Also, I didn't implement the logic for creating a new `GFileSystem` instance in the `create_g_file_system` method. You would need to fill that out based on your specific requirements and implementation details.
