Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

class GFileSystemProbe:
    """An empty interface that is a common type for the real probe interfaces to derive from."""
    
    # empty class
```

Note: Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `interface` keyword, so we use classes instead with no methods or attributes defined in them.
