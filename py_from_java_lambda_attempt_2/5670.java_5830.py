Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import io

class GFileSystemProbeByteProvider:
    def probe(self, byte_provider: bytes, fs_service: object, monitor: object) -> bool:
        """
        Probes the specified ByteProvider to determine if this filesystem implementation
        can handle the file.

        :param byte_provider: a bytes-like object containing the contents of the file being probed.
        :param fs_service: a reference to the FileSystemService object
        :param monitor: a TaskMonitor that should be polled to see if the user has requested to cancel the operation, and updated with progress information.
        :return: True if the specified file is handled by this filesystem implementation, False otherwise.
        """
        # Implementor's note: do not close byte_provider here
        try:
            # implement your probing logic here
            return True  # or False depending on whether you can handle the file
        except (io.IOException, CancelledException) as e:
            raise
```
Note that I've used Python's type hints to indicate the types of the method parameters and return value. In particular:

* `byte_provider` is a bytes-like object (`bytes`)
* `fs_service` and `monitor` are objects with no specific type information (since they don't have any meaningful methods or attributes in this context)
* The method returns a boolean value

I've also used Python's docstring syntax to document the method.
