Here is the translation of the Java interface `BinaryAnalysisCommand` into a Python class:

```python
class BinaryAnalysisCommand:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def can_apply(self, program: 'Program') -> bool:
        """Returns TRUE if this command can be applied to the given domain object."""
        return True  # Replace with your implementation

    def apply_to(self, program: 'Program', monitor) -> bool:
        """Applies the command to the given domain object."""
        try:
            # Replace with your implementation
            pass
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error applying command: {e}")
            return False
        return True

    def get_messages(self) -> 'MessageLog':
        """Returns the status message indicating the status of the command."""
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")

    def get_name(self) -> str:
        """Returns the name of this command."""
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")
```

Note that I've used Python's type hinting to indicate the types of the method parameters and return values. In particular, I've used strings for `Program` and `MessageLog`, as these are likely classes defined elsewhere in your codebase.

Also note that I've left some parts blank (e.g., the implementation of `can_apply`, `apply_to`, etc.), as you'll need to fill those in with your specific logic.
