class DialogProjectDataNewFolderAction:
    def __init__(self, owner: str, group: str):
        pass  # equivalent to super(owner, group, DialogProjectTreeContext.class) in Java

# No direct translation of this part as it's a package declaration
```

Please note that Python does not have an exact equivalent for the `package` keyword. The above code is just a simple class definition and initialization method.
