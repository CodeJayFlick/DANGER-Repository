Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class BlockFlowGraphType:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Block Flow Graph", "Shows program basic block flow")
```
Note that I've kept the same class name and method names as in the original Java code, but translated them to their equivalent forms in Python. Specifically:

* `public` is not needed in Python (it's implicit for classes)
* `class BlockFlowGraphType:` defines a new class
* The constructor (`__init__`) takes no arguments by default
* `super()` calls the parent class's constructor, just like in Java

That's it!
