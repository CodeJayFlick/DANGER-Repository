Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class LCSSelectionEvent:
    def __init__(self, selection):
        self.selection = selection

    def __str__(self):
        return f"LSE{{{selection}}}"
```
Note that I've used the `__init__` method instead of a constructor, and the `__str__` method to implement the equivalent of Java's `toString()` method.
