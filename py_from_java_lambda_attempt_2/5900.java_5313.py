Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class AddressSetTableModel:
    def __init__(self, title: str, serviceProvider, program: dict, address_set_view: object, task_monitor):
        self.address_set = address_set_view
        super().__init__(title=title, service_provider=serviceProvider, prog=program, monitor=task_monitor)

    @property
    def do_load(self) -> None:
        accumulator = Accumulator()
        try:
            for address in self.address_set.get_addresses(True):
                if task_monitor.check_canceled():
                    raise CancelledException
                accumulator.add(address)
                task_monitor.increment_progress(1)
        except CancelledException as e:
            print(f"Cancelled: {e}")
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `@Override` annotation. Also, the code is translated to a more Pythonic way and some assumptions are made about the types of variables based on their usage in the original Java code.

Here are some key differences:

- In Python, we don't need to specify the type of every variable.
- The equivalent of Java's `@Override` annotation does not exist in Python. Instead, you can use a docstring or a comment to indicate that this method is overriding its parent class' method.
- Python uses indentation instead of curly braces for block-level structure.
- In Python, we don't need to specify the type of every variable.
