Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AbstractProgramBasedDynamicTableColumn:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def __init__(self, unique_id: str = None):
        if unique_id is not None:
            # implement your logic here for initializing with a unique ID
            pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java's generics or abstract classes. The equivalent of Java's generic type parameter `<ROW_TYPE, COLUMN_TYPE>` in Python would be the use of Python's built-in types (e.g., `int`, `str`) or custom-defined classes.

The equivalent of Java's abstract class is a regular Python class that can contain both concrete and abstract methods.
