Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AddressTableDataTableColumn:
    def __init__(self):
        self.monospaced_renderer = MonospacedRenderer()

    class MonospacedRenderer:
        def configure_font(self, table, model, column):
            pass  # Set font to fixed-width font

        def get_filter_string(self, t, settings):
            return t

    def get_column_display_name(self, settings):
        return self.get_column_name()

    def get_column_name(self):
        return "Data (Hex/Ascii)"

    def get_value(self, row_object, settings, program, service_provider):
        try:
            return str(row_object.get_table_type_string(program.get_memory()))
        except Exception as e:
            raise ValueError(str(e))

    def get_program_location(self, row_object, settings, program, service_provider):
        return ProgramLocation(program, row_object.get_top_address())

class ProgramLocation:
    def __init__(self, program, address):
        self.program = program
        self.address = address

# You can use the class like this:

column = AddressTableDataTableColumn()
print(column.get_column_name())  # prints "Data (Hex/Ascii)"
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's Swing and TableModel. The code above is a simplified translation, you may need to implement more complex logic for table rendering in Python.

Also, the `ServiceProvider` class from the original Java code has no direct equivalent in Python. You would likely want to use some kind of dependency injection or service locator pattern if you were implementing this in Python.
