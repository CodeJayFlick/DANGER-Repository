Here is a translation of the provided Java interface into equivalent Python code:

```Python
import ctypes

class HRESULT(int):
    pass

class JavaProviderNative:
    _lib = None
    
    def __init__(cls):
        if cls._lib is None:
            try:
                cls._lib = ctypes.WinDLL("javaprovider")
            except OSError as e:
                print(f"Failed to load library: {e}")
    
    @classmethod
    def create_client(cls, client):
        return HRESULT(0)  # Assuming a successful creation

# Usage example:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    jpn = JavaProviderNative()
    client = ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_void_p)(ctypes.addressof(None))
    result = jpn.create_client(client)
```

Please note that this translation is not perfect, as Python does not have direct equivalents for some of the Java concepts used in your code. For example:

- The `package` declaration and the `import` statements are not directly translatable to Python.
- The `interface` keyword has no equivalent in Python; instead, we define a class with methods.
- The `Pointer` type is replaced by using ctypes' `POINTER` function.

This code should be used as an example of how you might translate the provided Java interface into equivalent Python code.
