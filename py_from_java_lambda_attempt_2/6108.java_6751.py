Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class MergeProgramModifier:
    def initialize_program(self, program):
        # user-defined

    def modify_latest(self, program):
        # user-defined

    def modify_private(self, program):
        # user-define
```
Note that I've kept the method names and parameter lists identical to the original Java code. In Python, we don't need explicit `public` or `abstract` keywords, as everything is public by default. The class definition uses the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class.

The methods are defined using the `def` statement, with the method name and parameter list specified in parentheses. The `self` parameter is used to refer to the instance of the class itself, which is a convention in Python for defining object-oriented code.
