Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This file is licensed under Apache License 2.0.
# You may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

class StructureImplLittleEndianBitFieldTest:
    pass
```

Note that I've kept the class definition and added a `pass` statement to make it a valid Python code, as there's no direct equivalent of Java classes or packages in Python.
