Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

class UnionImplBigEndianBitFieldTest:
    pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `package`, `public class`, and other constructs, so I've simply omitted them in this translation.
