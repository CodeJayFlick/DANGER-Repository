Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import tkinter as tk
from PIL import ImageTk, Image

class OptionsAction:
    OPTIONS_ICON = None  # Load image using Pillow library or any other suitable method for your environment.

    def __init__(self, provider: 'ByteViewerComponentProvider', plugin):
        self.provider = provider
        self.tool = plugin.get_tool()
        super().__init__("Byte Viewer Options", plugin.name)
        self.set_enabled(False)  # Set the action's enabled state.
        self.setDescription("Set Byte Viewer Options")
        self.setToolBarData(ToolbarData(OPTIONS_ICON, "ZSettings"))


    def actionPerformed(self, context):
        self.tool.show_dialog(ByteViewerOptionsDialog(self.provider), self.provider)

class ToolbarData:
    def __init__(self, icon: 'ImageIcon', text: str):
        pass  # Implement this class as needed.

class ByteViewerComponentProvider:
    pass  # Implement this class as needed.


class PluginTool:
    def get_tool(self):
        return None  # Return the actual tool instance.
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `ActionContext`, so I removed it. Also, Python doesn't support multiple inheritance like Java (it supports single inheritance), so you might need to adjust your code accordingly.

The above translation is based on the assumption that you are using a GUI library such as Tkinter for creating graphical user interfaces in Python.
