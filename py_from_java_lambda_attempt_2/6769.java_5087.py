I'd be happy to help you with that! Here is a translation of your Java code into Python:

```python
import unittest.main()

def test_disassembled_recognition():
    # verify that undefined bytes are marked with '.'

class Disassembled_format_model:
    class ByteViewerOptionsDialog(d):
        return d

#  Once again, translate the above code to Python.
```
