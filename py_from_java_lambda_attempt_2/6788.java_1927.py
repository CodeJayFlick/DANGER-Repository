Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class GraphSelectedAST:
    def get_pcode_op_iterator(self):
        return self.high.get_pcode_ops(self.current_address)

# Note: The high and current_address variables are not defined in this snippet.
```

Please note that you would need to define `high` and `current_address` for the above Python code to work.
