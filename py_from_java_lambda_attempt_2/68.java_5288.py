Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class SelectionTranslator:
    def convert_field_to_address(self, field_selection):
        # Implement your logic here for converting FieldSelection to AddressSetView
        pass

    def convert_address_to_field(self, addresses: 'AddressSetView'):
        # Implement your logic here for converting AddressSetView to FieldSelection
        pass

    def convert_address_to_field(self, range: 'AddressRange') -> 'FieldSelection':
        # Implement your logic here for converting AddressRange to FieldSelection
        pass

    def convert_address_to_field(self, address) -> 'FieldSelection':
        return self.convert_address_to_field(AddressRange(address, address))
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface concept. Instead, we use a class with abstract methods in the above code. The `pass` statement is used to indicate where you would put your actual implementation logic for each method.
