Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class ClangFuncProto:
    def __init__(self, par):
        pass

import ghidra
```
Note that I did not translate the Java comments to Python comments, as they are not necessary in Python. Also, I used the `pass` statement in the constructor (`__init__`) method since it does not seem to have any specific functionality.

The last line imports the `ghidra` module, which is likely a custom module specific to your project or environment.
