Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DbgBreakpointEvent:
    def __init__(self, info):
        super().__init__(info)
```

Note that this Python class does not have a direct equivalent to Java's `extends AbstractDbgEvent<DebugBreakpoint>` as Python is dynamically typed and doesn't require explicit type declarations. The given code defines a simple class with an initializer method (`__init__`) which takes one argument, `info`.
