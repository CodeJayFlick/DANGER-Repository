Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
from typing import TypeVar, List

class DecompilerReducer:
    def reduce(self, dominant_pairs: List[tuple]) -> R:
        pass  # implement this method
```
Note that I've used type hints for the `reduce` method and the `dominant_pairs` parameter. In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's generics system, so we use type hints instead.

Also, since there is no implementation provided in the original code, I left the `reduce` method as an abstract method with a placeholder comment (`pass`).
