Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class DbgInitialModuleLoadEvent:
    def __init__(self, info):
        super().__init__(info)
```
Note that I've removed all the unnecessary comments and licensing information, as well as the package declaration (which isn't necessary in Python). The `AbstractDbgEvent` class is not defined here, so it's assumed to be a separate entity.
