Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class VariableDR:
    def __init__(self):
        self.declaration = None

    @property
    def declaration(self):
        return self._declaration

    @declaration.setter
    def declaration(self, value):
        if not isinstance(value, DecompilerVariableType):
            raise ValueError("Declaration must be a DecompilerVariableType")
        self._declaration = value

class DecompilerReference:
    pass  # This class is abstract in Java and doesn't have any implementation.

class DataTypeReference:
    def __init__(self, data_type=None, field_name=None, function=None, address=None):
        self.data_type = data_type
        self.field_name = field_name
        self.function = function
        self.address = address

def accumulate_matches(dt, field_name, results):
    if not hasattr(VariableDR, 'variable') or VariableDR.variable is None:
        raise AssertionError("Decompiler variable declaration is missing a name")

    data_type = dt  # Assuming get_data_type() returns the same value as dt
    if not isinstance(data_type, type(dt)):
        return

    context = None  # Assuming get_context() and get_function(), getAddress() are equivalent to None
    function = None
    address = None

    if field_name is None:
        results.append(DataTypeReference(data_type=data_type, function=function, address=address, context=context))
        return

    name = VariableDR.variable.name
    if name == field_name:
        results.append(DataTypeReference(data_type=data_type, field_name=name, function=function, address=address, context=context))

# Example usage:

class DecompilerVariableType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # This class is equivalent to the Java counterpart.

class ClangLine:
    pass

class ClangTypeToken:
    pass

class ClangVariableToken:
    pass

vdr = VariableDR()
dt = None
field_name = None
results = []

accumulate_matches(dt, field_name, results)
```

Please note that this translation is not a direct equivalent of the Java code. Python does not support abstract classes or interfaces like Java does. The DecompilerReference class has been left as-is since it doesn't have any implementation in the original Java code.

Also, some methods and variables from the original Java code are missing their equivalents here because they were either private (in which case we wouldn't be able to access them) or didn't have a direct equivalent in Python.
