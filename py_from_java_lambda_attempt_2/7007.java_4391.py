Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class Decryptor:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def isValid(self, provider: bytes) -> bool:
        # Implement your decryption validation logic here.
        return True  # Replace with actual implementation.

    def decrypt(self, firmware_name: str, firmware_path: str, provider: bytes, monitor=None) -> None:
        try:
            # Implement your decryption logic here.
            pass
        except (IOError, CryptoException, CancelledException):
            if monitor is not None and isinstance(monitor, object):
                monitor.cancel()
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's interfaces or classes. Instead, we use abstract base classes (`ABC`) to define the interface of a class. However, since you didn't provide any specific implementation details in your original code, I've kept this translation simple and left out most of the actual decryption logic.

In real-world scenarios, you would need to implement these methods according to your requirements for validation and decryption.
