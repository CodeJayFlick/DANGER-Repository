Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class BootImageHeaderV4:
    def __init__(self):
        self.signature_size = None

    def get_signature_size(self):
        return self.signature_size


class BootImageConstants:
    V4_PAGE_SIZE = 0  # Assuming this is an integer constant, replace with actual value if needed


def to_data_type(self) -> dict:
    structure = super().to_data_type()
    try:
        structure['name'] = "boot_img_hdr_v4"
    except Exception as e:
        pass
    structure['signature_size'] = self.signature_size
    return structure

# Example usage:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    boot_image_header_v4 = BootImageHeaderV4()
    # Set the signature size here if needed
    print(boot_image_header_v4.get_signature_size())
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `BinaryReader`, `DataType`, and `Structure` classes. The above code is a simplified translation of your given Java code into equivalent Python, assuming you are working with dictionaries to represent data structures.

Also, the original Java code seems to be part of an Android boot image format parser in Ghidra, which is not directly applicable to standard Python programming.
