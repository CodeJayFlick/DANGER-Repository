Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DbgThreadExitedEvent:
    def __init__(self, exit_code):
        self.exit_code = exit_code


# Note: There's no direct equivalent for Java's AbstractDbgEvent class in Python.
# We can create a base class if needed. For simplicity, let's just use the above event class.

class DbgThreadExitedEventWithCode(DbgThreadExitedEvent):
    def __init__(self, exit_code):
        super().__init__(exit_code)
```

In this translation:

- The `DbgThreadExitedEvent` class is translated into a Python class with an initializer method (`__init__`) that takes one argument: the exit code.
- Since there's no direct equivalent for Java's abstract classes in Python, we can create our own base class if needed. For simplicity, let's just use the above event class without any inheritance from another class.

Please note that this is a simple translation and might not cover all edge cases or handle exceptions as per your requirements.
