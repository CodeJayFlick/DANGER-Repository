Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python

# You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

class Modifiers:
    pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `package`, `public final class`, and `//TODO` comments, so I omitted those parts in the translation.
