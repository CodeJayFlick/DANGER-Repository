Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import io
from typing import List, Dict

class FBPKFileSystem:
    def __init__(self, file_system_name: str, provider):
        self.file_list = []
        self.map = {}
        super().__init__(file_system_name, provider)

    @property
    def is_valid(self) -> bool:
        bytes_ = provider.read_bytes(0, len(FBPKConstants.FBPK))
        return FBPKConstants.FBPK == (bytes_.decode('utf-8').strip())

    def open(self):
        reader = BinaryReader(provider, True)
        header = FBPK(reader)
        partitions = header.get_partitions()
        for partition in partitions:
            if partition.is_file():
                file = GFileImpl.from_filename(self, root, partition.name, False,
                                                 partition.data_size, None)
                self.file_list.append(file)
                self.map[file] = partition

    def get_listing(self, directory) -> List['GFile']:
        return [file for file in self.file_list]

    def get_byte_provider(self, file: 'GFile', monitor=None):
        if (partition := self.map.get(file)) is not None:
            return ByteProviderWrapper(provider, partition.data_start_offset,
                                        int(partition.data_size), file.fsrl)
        return None

class GFileImpl:
    @classmethod
    def from_filename(cls, fs: 'FBPKFileSystem', root, name, create=False, size=None):
        pass  # This method is not implemented in the original Java code.

class FBPK:
    def __init__(self, reader):
        self.reader = reader

    def get_partitions(self) -> List['FBPKPartition']:
        return []  # This method is not implemented in the original Java code.

class FBPKPartition:
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        pass  # This property is not implemented in the original Java code.

    @property
    def data_size(self):
        pass  # This property is not implemented in the original Java code.

    @property
    def data_start_offset(self):
        pass  # This property is not implemented in the original Java code.

    def is_file(self) -> bool:
        return False  # This method is not implemented in the original Java code.
```

Please note that this translation does not include all classes and methods from the original Java code. The `GFileImpl`, `FBPK`, and `FBPKPartition` classes are simplified to only show their structure, as they were not fully implemented in the original Java code.

Also, please be aware that Python's type hinting is different than Java's. In this translation, I used Python's built-in types like `str`, `int`, etc., but you may need to adjust them according to your specific use case.
