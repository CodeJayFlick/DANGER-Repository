Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class OatDexFile_Android11:
    def __init__(self, reader, vdex_header):
        super().__init__(reader, vdex_header)

    def to_data_type(self) -> dict:
        data_type = super().to_data_type()
        try:
            class_name = type(self).__name__
            data_type['name'] = class_name
        except Exception as e:
            pass  # ignore the exception

        return data_type


# Usage example:

class BinaryReader:  # This is a placeholder for Java's BinaryReader, you would need to implement this in Python.
    def read(self):
        pass

vdex_header = "some vdex header"  # You would replace this with actual VdexHeader object.

oat_dex_file_android11 = OatDexFile_Android11(BinaryReader(), vdex_header)

data_type = oat_dex_file_android11.to_data_type()
print(data_type)
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `package`, `import` statements. Also, the concept of inheritance and polymorphism is different in both languages. The above code is a simple translation of given Java code into Python, it may not be exactly same as original Java code due to differences between two languages.
