Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class OatQuickMethodHeaderLollipop:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mapping_table_offset = None
        self.vmap_table_offset = None
        self.frame_info = None
        self.code_size = None

    def read_from_reader(self, reader):
        try:
            self.mapping_table_offset = reader.read_int()
            self.vmap_table_offset = reader.read_int()
            self.frame_info = QuickMethodFrameInfo(reader)
            self.code_size = reader.read_int()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error reading from reader: {e}")

    def get_mapping_table_offset(self):
        return self.mapping_table_offset

    def get_vmap_table_offset(self):
        return self.vmap_table_offset

    def get_frame_info(self):
        return self.frame_info

    def get_code_size(self):
        return self.code_size


class QuickMethodFrameInfo:
    def __init__(self, reader):
        pass  # Not implemented in this example

    def to_data_type(self):
        pass  # Not implemented in this example
```

Note that I did not implement the `QuickMethodFrameInfo` class and its methods as they were not provided in the original code. Also, Python does not have direct equivalents of Java's classes like `BinaryReader`, so you would need to create your own reader class or use a library that provides similar functionality.

Also note that this is just one possible translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python code. The actual implementation may vary depending on specific requirements and constraints.
