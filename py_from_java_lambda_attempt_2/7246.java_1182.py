Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

class VerifyMode:
    kNone = 'kNone'
    kEnable = 'kEnable'
    kSoftFail = 'kSoftFail'

print(VerifyMode.kNone)
print(VerifyMode.kEnable)
print(VerifyMode.kSoftFail)

```

Note: Python does not have an exact equivalent of Java's enum. The above code uses a class with static variables to mimic the behavior of enums in Java.
