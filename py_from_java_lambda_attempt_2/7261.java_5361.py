Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Define a class enum for NSNumberTypes in Python
class NSNumberTypes:
    BYTE = 1
    SHORT = 2
    INTEGER = 3
    LONG = 4
    REAL = 5
    BOOLEAN = 6

print(NSNumberTypes.BYTE)  # Output: 1
```

Please note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's enum. The above code is using class as an approximation of the concept, where each instance represents one type from the original enumeration.
