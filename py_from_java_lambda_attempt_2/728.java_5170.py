Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class DbgEndSteppingRangeReason:
    def __init__(self, info):
        # Nothing additional to parse
        pass

    def desc(self):
        return "Stepping ended"
```
Note that I've kept the method names and variable names similar to their original counterparts in Java.
