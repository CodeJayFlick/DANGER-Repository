Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class GZipConstants:
    MAGIC_BYTES_COUNT = 2
    MAGIC_BYTES = bytes([0x1f, 0x8b])
```

Note that in Python, we don't need to specify `public` or `static`, as these are implicit. Also, the equivalent of Java's `final` keyword is not needed in Python for variables defined at class level.
