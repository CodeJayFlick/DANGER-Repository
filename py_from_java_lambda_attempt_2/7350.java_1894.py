Here is a translation of the provided Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class HFSPlusFileSystemFactory:
    def probe(self, byte_provider: bytes, fs_service: object, monitor: dict) -> bool:
        from hfsplus_volume_header import HFSPlusVolumeHeader
        return HFSPlusVolumeHeader.probe(byte_provider)

    def create(self, target_fsrl: str, byte_provider: bytes, fs_service: object, monitor: dict) -> 'HFSPlusFileSystem':
        try:
            from hfs_plus_file_system import HFSPlusFileSystem
            fs = HFSPlusFileSystem(target_fsrl, fs_service)
            fs.mount(byte_provider, monitor)
            return fs
        except Exception as e:
            if isinstance(e, IOError):
                fs.close()
            raise

class HFSPlusFileSystem:
    def __init__(self, target_fsrl: str, fs_service: object) -> None:
        pass  # Add implementation here

    def mount(self, byte_provider: bytes, monitor: dict) -> None:
        pass  # Add implementation here

    def close(self) -> None:
        pass  # Add implementation here
```

Note that this translation is not a direct conversion from Java to Python. It's more of an equivalent representation in terms of structure and functionality.

- The `HFSPlusFileSystemFactory` class has been translated into a simple Python class with the same methods.
- The `HFSPlusFileSystem` class is also represented as a simple Python class, but its implementation details are missing (you would need to add them based on your specific requirements).
- Error handling in Java's try-catch block has been replaced by Python's equivalent error handling mechanism using `try-except`.
- Some types and classes have been translated into their Python equivalents.
