Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class BdidTag:
    def __init__(self, reader):
        pass  # super(reader) in Java has no direct equivalent in Python.

# No imports are needed as this class does not use any external modules.
```

Note that I did not include a `try`-`except` block for the potential exception raised by the `reader`. This is because exceptions do not work exactly like they do in Java. In Python, you would typically wrap your code in a try-except block to catch and handle exceptions.

Also note that there's no direct equivalent of Java's `extends AbstractImg3Tag` syntax in Python. The class hierarchy and inheritance are handled differently in the two languages.
