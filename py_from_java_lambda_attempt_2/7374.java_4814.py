Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class CertificateTag:
    def __init__(self, reader):
        pass  # super(reader) in Java


# Note: In Python, we don't have a direct equivalent to Java's BinaryReader class.
#       We can use built-in file operations or libraries like 'struct' for binary data handling.

import io

class CertificateTag:
    def __init__(self, reader):
        self.reader = reader
```

Note that the `BinaryReader` in Java is not directly translatable to Python. In Python, you would typically read and process binary files using built-in file operations or libraries like `'struct'`. The provided code does not include any actual reading of binary data as it was part of the original Java class.
