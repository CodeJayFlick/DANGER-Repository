Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class ExclusiveChipTag:
    def __init__(self, reader):
        pass  # Assuming BinaryReader class has been defined elsewhere in your program


# Note: In Python, you don't need to declare types for methods or variables. Also,
#       Python doesn't have a direct equivalent of Java's "throws" keyword.
```

Please note that this is not a straightforward translation as the provided code seems to be part of a larger system (Ghidra) and some classes might not exist in standard Python libraries.
