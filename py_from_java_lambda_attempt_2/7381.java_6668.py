Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class RsaShaTag:
    def __init__(self, reader):
        pass  # Equivalent to super(reader)

# No direct equivalent for throws IOException in Python.
```

Note that this Python class does not have a direct equivalent to the `throws IOException` declaration in the Java code. In Python, exceptions are typically raised using the built-in `raise` statement or by calling functions that may raise exceptions.

Also note that I've used the `pass` keyword as a placeholder for the constructor (`__init__`) method, since there is no direct equivalent to the `super(reader)` call in Java's constructor.
