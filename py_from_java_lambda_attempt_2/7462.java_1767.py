Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
classFullScreenModeVertexActionContextInfo:
    def __init__(self, vertex):
        super().__init__(vertex)

# Note: In Python, we don't need a separate class definition for VertexActionContextInfo
# since it's not being used as an independent entity. The above class can be considered equivalent to the Java code.
```
Note that I've kept the same name and structure as the original Java code, but adapted it to Python syntax and semantics.
