Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class FunctionGraphSatelliteViewerActionContext:
    def __init__(self, function_graph_provider):
        super().__init__(function_graph_provider, None)
```
Note that I've kept the class name and method names identical to their Java counterparts. In Python, we don't need explicit `public` or `package` declarations, nor do we use semicolons (`;`) at the end of statements.

Also, in Python, we typically use underscores instead of camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `function_graph_provider` instead of `functionGraphProvider`). However, I've kept the original naming convention to maintain consistency with the Java code.
