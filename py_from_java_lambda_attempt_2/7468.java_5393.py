Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class FunctionGraphValidGraphActionContext:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_selected_vertices(self) -> set:
        return set()
```

Note that in this translation, I have used a class instead of an interface as interfaces are not directly supported in Python. The `get_selected_vertices` method is defined to return a set (which is equivalent to Java's Set).
