Here is the translation of the Java interface `FGColorProvider` to a Python class:

```python
class FGColorProvider:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def using_custom_colors(self) -> bool:
        return False  # Replace with your implementation

    def get_recent_colors(self) -> list:
        return []  # Replace with your implementation

    def most_recent_color(self) -> tuple:  # Assuming Color is a tuple of RGB values
        return (0, 0, 0)

    def color_from_user(self, old_color: tuple) -> tuple:
        return old_color  # Replace with your implementation

    def save_plugin_colors(self):
        pass  # Replace with your implementation

    def load_plugin_color(self):
        pass  # Replace with your implementation

    def save_vertex_colors(self, vertex, settings):
        pass  # Replace with your implementation

    def load_vertex_colors(self, vertex, settings):
        pass  # Replace with your implementation

    def set_vertex_color(self, vertex: object, new_color: tuple) -> None:
        pass  # Replace with your implementation

    def clear_vertex_color(self, vertex: object) -> None:
        pass  # Replace with your implementation
```

Note that I had to make some assumptions about the `Color` class in Java and how it would be represented in Python. In particular, I assumed that a color is simply a tuple of RGB values (0-255). If this is not correct, you will need to modify the code accordingly.

Also, keep in mind that this translation is just one possible way to translate the Java interface to Python. The actual implementation may vary depending on your specific use case and requirements.
