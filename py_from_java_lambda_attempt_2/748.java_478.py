Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from concurrent.futures import Future

class DbgModelTargetKillable:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def kill(self) -> Future[None]:
        process = self.get_manager().get_current_process()
        return self.get_model().gate_future(process.kill())

# Note: The following classes are not directly translatable to Python
#       They need to be implemented separately in Python.
class DbgProcess:
    pass

class DbgModelTargetObject:
    pass

class TargetKillable:
    pass

class CompletableFuture:
    def __init__(self, result):
        self.result = result

    def get(self) -> None:
        return self.result
```

Please note that the above Python code is not a direct translation of Java. The classes `DbgProcess`, `DbgModelTargetObject` and `TargetKillable` are abstract in nature and do not have any equivalent implementation in Python.
