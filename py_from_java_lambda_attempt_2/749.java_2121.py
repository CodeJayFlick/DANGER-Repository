Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from typing import List, Any

class DbgModelTargetLauncher:
    def launch(self, args: List[str]) -> Any:
        try:
            return self.get_model().gate_future(self.get_manager().launch(args))
        except Exception as e:
            raise DebuggerUserException(f"Launch failed for {args}") from e
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java's interfaces and classes. Instead, we define a class `DbgModelTargetLauncher` with the same methods and behavior.

Also note that in Python, you don't need to specify types explicitly like you do in Java. The type hinting is optional but can be useful for documentation purposes or when using static analysis tools.

In this translation:

- We removed the `@Override` annotation as it's not necessary in Python.
- We replaced the `public default CompletableFuture< Void > launch(List<String> args)` method with a regular instance method that returns any type (`Any`) and takes a list of strings as an argument. The method tries to execute some code, catches exceptions if they occur, and raises a custom exception if there's an error.
- We removed the `extends` keyword as it's not necessary in Python.

This translation is equivalent to the original Java code but might behave slightly differently due to differences between languages.
