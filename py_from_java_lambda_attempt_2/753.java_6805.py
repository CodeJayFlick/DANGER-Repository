Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class DbgModelTargetAvailable:
    PID_ATTRIBUTE_NAME = "pid"

    def get_pid(self):
        pass  # TODO: implement this method

    def set_base(self, value):
        pass  # TODO: implement this method
```

Note that the `PREFIX_INVISIBLE` and other constants are not defined in the given Java code. Therefore, I did not include them in the Python translation.
