Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class DbgModelTargetDebugContainer:
    pass

```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we define a class with no methods (i.e., an "empty" class). This is similar in spirit to how interfaces are used in Java - they provide a contract for implementing classes without defining any specific behavior themselves.
