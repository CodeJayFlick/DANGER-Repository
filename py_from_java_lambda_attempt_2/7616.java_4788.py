Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This line is a comment in Python, same as it was in Java.
# It's not necessary but can be useful for documentation.

class HashLookupListMode:
    """Enumeration indicating if a hash should be considered 
       as the full or specific hash."""
    
    FULL = 1
    SPECIFIC = 2

```

Note that this is an equivalent translation, and it does not exactly replicate the Java code. Python has different syntax for defining classes and enums compared to Java.
