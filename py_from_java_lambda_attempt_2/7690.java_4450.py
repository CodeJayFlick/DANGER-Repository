Here is the translation of the Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class FcgVertexExpansionListener:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def toggle_incoming_vertices(self, v):
        """Show or hide those vertices that are on incoming edges to v"""
        # Your code here
        pass

    def toggle_outgoing_vertices(self, v):
        """Show or hide those vertices that are on outgoing edges to v"""
        # Your code here
        pass
```

Note: In Python, we don't have an exact equivalent of Java's interface. Instead, we can use a class with abstract methods (methods without implementation) as shown above.
