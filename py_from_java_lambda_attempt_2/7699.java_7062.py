Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import matplotlib.colors as mcolors

class FcgVertexPaintTransformer:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color

    def apply(self, v):
        return self.color
```
Note that I used the `matplotlib` library for colors, since it's a common and powerful library in Python. If you don't want to use `matplotlib`, you can simply define your own custom color class or use another existing one.

Also, keep in mind that this is just a direct translation of the Java code to Python, without considering any specific requirements or best practices for Python programming.
