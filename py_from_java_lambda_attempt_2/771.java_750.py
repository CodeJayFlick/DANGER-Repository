Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DbgModelTargetModuleSection:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_range(self) -> 'AddressRange':
        # Implement this method as per your requirement.
        pass


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AddressRange(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def __str__(self):
        pass

# You can add more methods to the class if needed.

```

Note: Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface. However, we can achieve similar functionality using Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) in Python.
