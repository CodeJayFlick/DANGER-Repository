Here is the translation of the Java code into Python:

```Python
class ExportAttributedGraphDisplay:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # No equivalent in Python for PluginTool

    def close(self):
        return None  # This display is not interactive, so N/A

    def set_graph_display_listener(self, listener):
        if listener:  # This display is not interactive, so just dispose the listener
            listener.dispose()

    def do_set_graph_data(self, attributed_graph):
        exporters = self.find_graph_exporters()
        dialog = GraphExporterDialog(attributed_graph, exporters)
        return None  # No equivalent in Python for tool.showDialog

    def find_graph_exporters(self):
        service = None  # No equivalent in Python for GraphDisplayBroker
        if not service:
            return []
        else:
            return []

    def set_graph(self, graph, title, append=False, monitor=None):
        self.title = title
        self.graph = graph
        self.do_set_graph_data(graph)

    def clear(self):
        pass  # This display is not interactive, so N/A

    def update_vertex_name(self, vertex, new_name):
        return None  # do nothing

    @property
    def graph_title(self):
        return self.title

    def add_action(self, action):
        pass  # actions are not supported by this display

    def get_focused_vertex(self):
        return None  # This display is not interactive, so N/A

    def get_selected_vertices(self):
        return set()  # This display is not interactive, so N/A

    @property
    def focused_vertex(self):
        return self.get_focused_vertex()

    def select_vertices(self, vertex_list=None, event_trigger=None):
        pass  # This display is not interactive, so N/A


class GraphExporterDialog:
    def __init__(self, attributed_graph, exporters):
        pass  # No equivalent in Python for tool.showDialog

# Note: The above code does not include the implementation of AttributedGraph and related classes as they are specific to your application.

This translation is based on my understanding of Java syntax. However, please note that some parts might be missing or incorrect due to differences between languages.
