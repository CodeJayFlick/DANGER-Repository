Here is the translation of the Java interface `GraphRenderer` into a Python class:

```Python
class GraphRenderer:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def initialize_viewer(self, viewer: 'VisualizationViewer[AttributedVertex, AttributedEdge]'):
        # Implement this method as needed for your graph rendering.
        pass

    def set_graph_type_display_options(self, options: 'GraphDisplayOptions'):
        # Implement this method as needed for your graph type display options.
        pass

    @property
    def graph_display_options(self) -> 'GraphDisplayOptions':
        return None  # Replace with actual implementation.

    def vertex_changed(self, vertex: 'AttributedVertex'):
        # Implement this method as needed when a vertex changes and needs to be redrawn.
        pass

    def get_favored_edge_type(self) -> str:
        return ''  # Replace with actual implementation.

    def get_edge_priority(self, edge_type: str) -> int:
        return -1  # Replace with actual implementation.

    def clear_cache(self):
        # Implement this method as needed to clear any cached renderings.
        pass

    @property
    def vertex_selection_color(self) -> 'Color':
        return None  # Replace with actual implementation.

    @property
    def edge_selection_color(self) -> 'Color':
        return None  # Replace with actual implementation.
```

Note that I've used type hints for the method parameters and return types, as well as properties. This is a Python feature called "type hinting" which helps other developers understand what types of data your functions expect or return.

Also note that some methods have been left blank (`pass`) because they don't have direct equivalents in Python (like Java's `interface` keyword).
