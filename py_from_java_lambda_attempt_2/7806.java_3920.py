Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This class represents a "complex" data type within a Microsoft mangled symbol.
class MDClassType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_type_name(self):
        return "class"
```

Note that in this translation, I have removed the `MDMang` parameter from the constructor as it is not directly equivalent to any Python concept.
