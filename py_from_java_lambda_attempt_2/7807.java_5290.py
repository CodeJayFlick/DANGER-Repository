Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MDCoclassType:
    def __init__(self, dmang, start_index_offset):
        super().__init__(dmang, start_index_offset)

    def get_type_name(self):
        return "coclass"
```

Note that in Python, we don't need to declare the types of variables or methods. Also, there is no direct equivalent of Java's `package` statement in Python.
