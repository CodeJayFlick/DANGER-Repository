Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MDExtendedType:
    def __init__(self, dmang):
        super().__init__(dmang, 2)

    def __init__(self, dmang, startIndexOffset):
        super().__init__(dmang, startIndexOffset)

    def get_type_name(self):
        return "_UKNOWNEXTENDEDDATATYPE_"
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `package`, `import` statements. Also, the concept of classes and inheritance is similar in both languages but there are some differences in syntax.
