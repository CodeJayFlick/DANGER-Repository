Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MDInt128DataType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_type_name(self) -> str:
        return "__int128"
```

Note that in this translation, I have removed all references to `MDMang` and `MDExtendedType`, as these are Java-specific classes. In Python, we do not need such explicit imports or class definitions.

Also note that the constructor (`__init__`) is now empty because there was no specific initialization required for the given code in Java.
