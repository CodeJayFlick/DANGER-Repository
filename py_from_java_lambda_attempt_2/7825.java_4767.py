Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MDUnknownRExtendedDataType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_type_name(self) -> str:
        return "<unknown>"

# Note: The MDMang class and its methods are not directly translatable to Python.
# In the given Java code, it seems that MDMang is used as a parameter in the constructor of MDUnknownRExtendedDataType. 
# If you want to replicate this functionality in Python, you would need to create your own equivalent class or use an existing one if available.

```

Please note that there are some limitations and differences between Java and Python when it comes to direct translation. For example:

- In the given code, MDMang is used as a parameter in the constructor of MDUnknownRExtendedDataType. This concept does not directly translate into Python.
- The `@Override` annotation in Java has no equivalent in Python. Instead, you would typically use inheritance and method overriding to achieve similar functionality.

If you have any further questions or need help with creating an equivalent class for MDMang in Python, please let me know!
