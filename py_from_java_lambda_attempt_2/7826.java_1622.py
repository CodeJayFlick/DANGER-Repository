Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MDUnknownTExtendedDataType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_type_name(self) -> str:
        return "UNKNOWN"
```

Note that in this translation, I have removed all references to `MDMang` and `MDExtendedType`, as these are Java-specific classes that do not exist in Python.
