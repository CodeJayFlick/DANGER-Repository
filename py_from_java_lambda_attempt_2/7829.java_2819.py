Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MDWcharDataType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_type_name(self) -> str:
        return "wchar_t"
```

Note that this is a simplified version, as it does not include any imports or references to other classes.
