Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MDDoubleDataType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_type_name(self) -> str:
        return "double"
```

Note that this is a simplified version, as Python does not have direct equivalents for some Java concepts like packages, imports, and annotations.
