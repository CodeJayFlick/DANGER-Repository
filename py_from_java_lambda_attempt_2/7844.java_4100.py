Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class MDCLIProperty:
    def __init__(self, dmang):
        super().__init__(dmang)

# class MDCLIProperty(String modifierTypeName, MDMang dmang) -> not implemented in this example
```

Note that I did not implement the second constructor and its corresponding method (`emit`) as they were commented out in the original Java code.
