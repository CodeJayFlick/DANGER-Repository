Here's your Java code translated into Python:

```Python
class MDDataReferenceType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def parse_internal(self) -> None:
        # cvMod.setOtherType()
        super().parse_internal()

    def parse_array_property(self) -> None:
        return


# Note: In Java, the equivalent of a constructor is called `__init__`. Python does not have an exact equivalent to Java's package declaration. The `MDException` and `MDMang` classes are also missing in this translation.
```

This code doesn't include any exceptions or error handling like your original Java code did.
