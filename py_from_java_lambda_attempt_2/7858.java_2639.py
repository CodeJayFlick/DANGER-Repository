Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class MDPointerRefDataType:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # Initialize with default values for now.

    def parse_referenced_type(self) -> 'MDDataType':
        return MDDataTypeParser().parse_basic_data_type(False)

    def parse_internal(self) -> None:
        super().parse_internal()

# Note: Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's "package" and "import". 
# Instead, you can use modules. For example, if you want to import a module named 'mdemangler', you would do it like this: from mdemangler import MDException
```

Please note that the above code is just an approximation of how the given Java code could be translated into Python. It does not include any specific error handling or exception classes as they are handled differently in Python compared to Java.

Also, please note that there's no direct equivalent for `MDMang`, `cvMod` and other similar variables in this translation because their functionality is unclear without more context about what these variables represent.
