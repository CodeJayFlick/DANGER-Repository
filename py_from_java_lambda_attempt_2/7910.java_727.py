class AbstractMDMetaClass:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    # This class represents a Microsoft C++ MetaClass, which is the basis
    # for some internal C++ structures.
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java's `package`, `public abstract class`, and `extends` keywords. Also, Python uses indentation instead of curly braces `{}` to define code blocks.
