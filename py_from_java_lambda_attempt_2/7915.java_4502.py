Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
# This class represents a Microsoft C++ RTTI1 internal structure.
class MDRTTI1:
    def __init__(self, dmang):
        pass  # No additional work at this time, but separate object for future extension.

import MDMang

class AbstractMDMetaClass:  # Assuming the original Java code has an abstract class
    pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `package`, `public` and `extends`. Also, Python classes do not need to be declared as `abstract`.
