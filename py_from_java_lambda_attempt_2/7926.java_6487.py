Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class MDVtordisp:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # No equivalent in this class

    @staticmethod
    def set_virtual():
        return "virtual"

    @staticmethod
    def set_thunk():
        return "thunk"


def parse_internal(self, dmang=None) -> None:
    if not isinstance(dmang, object):
        raise ValueError("dmang must be an instance of object")

    vtor_displacement = MDEncodedNumber(dmang)
    adjustment = MDEncodedNumber(dmang)

    try:
        vtor_displacement.parse()
        adjustment.parse()

        name_modifier = f"vtordisp{{{vtor_displacement}, {adjustment}}}"
        super().parse_internal()  # No equivalent in this class
    except MDException as e:
        raise


class MDEncodedNumber:
    def __init__(self, dmang):
        if not isinstance(dmang, object):
            raise ValueError("dmang must be an instance of object")

    def parse(self) -> None:
        pass  # No equivalent in this class
```

Please note that the given Java code is quite complex and does a lot more than what's shown here. This Python translation only includes parts that are directly comparable to the provided Java code, but it doesn't include all functionality from the original code.
