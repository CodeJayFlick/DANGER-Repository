Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# This class tests a demangler that is derived from MDMang using tests codified in MDMangBaseTest.
class MDemanglerVS2015Test:
    def __init__(self):
        self.test_configuration = MDVS2015TestConfiguration(be_quiet())

def be_quiet():
    # Implement your logic here
    pass

# This class is derived from MDBastTestConfiguration and is allocated below.
class MDVS2015TestConfiguration:
    def __init__(self, quiet):
        # Implement your logic here
        self.quiet = quiet
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's `public`, `extends` or `package`. Also, the concept of classes and objects in Python is slightly different from those in Java.
