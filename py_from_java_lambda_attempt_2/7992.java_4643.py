Here is the translation of the Java interface `IdMsParsable` into a Python class:

```python
class IdMsParsable:
    def get_pdb_id(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Method not implemented")
```

Note that in Python, we don't have an equivalent concept to Java's interfaces. Instead, we use abstract base classes (ABCs) or abstract methods with concrete implementations. In this case, I've chosen the latter approach by raising a `NotImplementedError` when the method is called.

The rest of the code is not relevant for translation purposes, as it consists mainly of licensing information and comments that are specific to Java.
