Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class Msf700:
    PAGE_NUMBER_SIZE = 4
    IDENTIFICATION = "Microsoft C/CC++ MSF 7.00\r\n\u001aDS".encode()
    IDENTIFICATION_PADDING = 3
    PAGE_SIZE_OFFSET = len(IDENTIFICATION) + IDENTIFICATION_PADDING

    NUM_REQUIRED_DETECTION_BYTES_700 = PAGE_SIZE_OFFSET + 4

    def __init__(self, file, pdb_options):
        super().__init__(file, pdb_options)

    def create(self):
        self.stream_table = MsfStreamTable700(self)
        self.free_page_map = MsfFreePageMap700(self)
        self.directory_stream = MsfDirectoryStream700(self)

    @staticmethod
    def detected(file):
        bytes_to_read = len(Msf700.IDENTIFICATION)
        file.seek(0)
        data = bytearray(bytes_to_read)
        file.readinto(data)
        return data == Msf700.IDENTIFICATION

class AbstractMsf:
    pass

class PdbByteReader:
    @staticmethod
    def parse_int(reader):
        # implement this method
        pass

class PdbException(Exception):
    pass

class RandomAccessFile:
    def seek(self, offset):
        pass

    def readinto(self, data):
        pass

# subclasses of Msf700 and AbstractMsf are not implemented here as they require more context.
```

Please note that this translation is not a direct conversion from Java to Python. Some parts like the `PdbByteReader.parse_int` method and some classes (`MsfStreamTable700`, `MsfFreePageMap700`, `MsfDirectoryStream700`) are left out because their implementation depends on specific context or requirements, which were not provided in your question.
