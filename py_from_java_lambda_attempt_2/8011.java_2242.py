Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import io
from typing import Optional


class MsfParser:
    @staticmethod
    def parse(filename: str, pdb_options: dict, monitor: object) -> Optional['AbstractMsf']:
        if not filename or not pdb_options or not monitor:
            return None

        try:
            with open(filename, 'r') as file:
                msf = MsfParser._detect_and_create_msf(file, pdb_options)
                if msf is None:
                    raise PdbException("MSF format not detected")
                msf.deserialize(monitor)
                return msf
        except (io.IOException, CancelledException) as e:
            raise e


class AbstractMsf:
    pass


class Msf200(AbstractMsf):
    @staticmethod
    def detected(file: io.BufferedReader) -> bool:
        # implement your logic here to detect MSF 200 format
        return True

    def __init__(self, file: io.BufferedReader, pdb_options: dict):
        self.file = file
        self.pdb_options = pdb_options


class Msf700(AbstractMsf):
    @staticmethod
    def detected(file: io.BufferedReader) -> bool:
        # implement your logic here to detect MSF 700 format
        return True

    def __init__(self, file: io.BufferedReader, pdb_options: dict):
        self.file = file
        self.pdb_options = pdb_options


def main():
    filename = "your_file_name"
    pdb_options = {"option1": "value1", "option2": "value2"}
    monitor = None  # implement your task monitor here

    try:
        msf = MsfParser.parse(filename, pdb_options, monitor)
        print(msf) if msf else print("MSF format not detected")
    except PdbException as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    except CancelledException as e:
        print(f"Cancelled: {e}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Note that the Python code does not have direct equivalent of Java's `RandomAccessFile` and `TaskMonitor`. In this translation, I used Python's built-in file handling mechanism (`with open(filename, 'r') as file`) to replace `RandomAccessFile`, and a simple placeholder for `TaskMonitor`. You would need to implement your own logic for these components based on the requirements of your application.
