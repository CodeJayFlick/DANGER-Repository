Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class Pdb200:
    def __init__(self, msf, pdb_options):
        super().__init__(msf, pdb_options)

    def deserialize_identifiers_only(self, monitor):
        try:
            reader = self.get_directory_reader(monitor)
            self.deserialize_version_signature_age(reader)
        except (IOError, PdbException) as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

    @staticmethod
    def get_directory_reader(monitor):
        # This method is not implemented in the given Java code.
        pass

    def deserialize_directory(self, monitor):
        try:
            reader = self.get_directory_reader(monitor)
            self.deserialize_version_signature_age(reader)
        except (IOError, PdbException) as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

    @staticmethod
    def get_directory_reader(monitor):
        # This method is not implemented in the given Java code.
        pass

    def dump_directory(self, writer):
        builder = StringBuilder()
        builder.append(self.dump_version_signature_age())
        writer.write(builder.toString())

class PdbByteReader:
    pass  # This class does not exist in Python. It was likely a custom reader for binary data.

class AbstractMsf:
    pass  # This class is abstract and has no implementation in the given Java code.

class CancelledException(Exception):
    pass

class IOException(Exception):
    pass

class PdbException(Exception):
    pass
```

Please note that this translation does not include all classes, methods or exceptions as they were present in the original Java code.
