class StringParseType:
    STRING_ST = 'StringSt'
    STRING_NT = 'StringNt'
    STRING_UTF8_ST = 'StringUtf8St'
    STRING_UTF8_NT = 'StringUtf8Nt'
    STRING_WCHAR_NT = 'StringWcharNt'

# End of Apache License 2.0
```

Please note that Python does not have an equivalent to Java's `enum` keyword, so we've used a class with constant variables instead.
