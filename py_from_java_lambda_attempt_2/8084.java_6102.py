Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class AbstractParameterSlotIndexFieldedLILMsSymbol:
    def __init__(self, pdb: 'AbstractPdb', reader: 'PdbByteReader', str_type):
        super().__init__(pdb, reader, str_type)

# Note that this is an abstract class in Java and Python does not have direct equivalent.
# In Python, you would typically create a base class with all the common methods
# and then subclass it for each specific type of symbol.

class PdbException(Exception):
    pass

class AbstractPdb:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

class PdbByteReader:
    def read(self) -> bytes:
        return b''

class StringParseType:
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return ''
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's abstract classes. In Python, you would typically create a base class with all the common methods and then subclass it for each specific type of symbol.
