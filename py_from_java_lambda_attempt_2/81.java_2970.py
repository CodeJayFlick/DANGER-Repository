Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class DebuggerInterpreterProvider:
    def __init__(self, plugin, interpreter, visible):
        super().__init__(plugin, interpreter, visible)
        self.sub_title = None

    def set_sub_title(self, subTitle: str) -> None:
        self.sub_title = subTitle
        super().set_sub_title(subTitle)

    def get_sub_title(self) -> str:
        return self.sub_title
```
Note that I've used the following Python features to translate the Java code:

* Classes and inheritance (`class DebuggerInterpreterProvider:`)
* Constructors (`__init__`)
* Method overriding (`@Override` is not needed in Python, but we can use `super()` to call the parent class's method)
* Type hints (e.g. `str`) are optional in Python, but I've included them for clarity
* The `None` type is used instead of Java's `null`
* The `return` statement is not needed at the end of a function, as it will return `None` by default

Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
