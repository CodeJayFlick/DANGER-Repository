Here is the translation of the given Java interface into a Python class:

```Python
class NameMsSymbol:
    """This class represents symbols that have a symbol name."""

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_name(self) -> str:
        """Returns the name."""
        return ""
```

Note: In this translation, I've used Python's `__init__` method to initialize any necessary attributes. The `get_name` method is equivalent to Java's `getName()` method and returns an empty string by default.
