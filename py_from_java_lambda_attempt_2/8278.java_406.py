Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class Public3216MsSymbol:
    PDB_ID = 0x0203

    def __init__(self, pdb: 'AbstractPdb', reader: 'PdbByteReader') -> None:
        super().__init__(pdb, reader, DataSymbolInternals.parse_3216(pdb, reader, False))

    def get_pdb_id(self) -> int:
        return self.PDB_ID

    def get_symbol_type_name(self) -> str:
        return "PUBSYM32_16"


class AbstractPublic16Or3216MsSymbol:
    pass


class DataSymbolInternals:
    @staticmethod
    def parse_3216(pdb: 'AbstractPdb', reader: 'PdbByteReader', is_private: bool) -> None:
        # This method should be implemented according to the requirements of your program.
        pass


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AbstractPdb(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_pdb(self) -> str:
        pass


class PdbByteReader:
    pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent for Java's `package`, `import` statements. Also, Python uses indentation to define block-level structure in the syntax, unlike Java which uses curly braces `{}`.

The above code is a translation of your given Java code into equivalent Python. However, it might require some modifications according to your actual program requirements and functionality.
