Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import asyncio

class DebuggerWrappedInterpreterConnection:
    def __init__(self, plugin: object, interpreter: object):
        pass  # Assuming these are initialized elsewhere in your program

    async def set_console(self, gui_console: object) -> None:
        await super().set_console(gui_console)
        gui_console.prompt = self.target_console.get_prompt()

    async def send_line(self, line: str) -> asyncio.Future:
        return await self.target_console.execute(line)

# Assuming you have a class for the target console
class TargetConsole:
    def __init__(self):
        pass  # Initialize your target console here

    async def execute(self, line: str) -> asyncio.Future:
        # Your code to handle executing lines goes here
        return None

async def main():
    plugin = object()  # Assuming you have a class for the debugger interpreter plugin
    interpreter = object()  # Assuming you have a class for the target interpreter
    connection = DebuggerWrappedInterpreterConnection(plugin, interpreter)

    await connection.set_console(object())  # Set your GUI console here

    while True:
        line = input("Enter command: ")
        if not line.strip():
            continue
        try:
            result = await connection.send_line(line)
            print(result)  # Handle the result of executing the line
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error occurred: {e}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

Please note that this is a direct translation from Java to Python, and you may need to adjust it based on your specific requirements.
