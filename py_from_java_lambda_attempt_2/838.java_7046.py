Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class AbstractModelForDbgengFactoryTest:
    def get_failing_factory_options(self):
        # TODO: No options to test for IN-VM variant
        return {}
```

Note that there are some significant differences between Java and Python. In particular, 

1. `package` statement is not needed in Python.
2. The concept of classes and inheritance is similar but the syntax is different.
3. Methods do not need explicit declaration of their return types or parameter lists.
4. Dictionaries (like `Map<...>` in Java) are created using `{}` instead of `Map.ofEntries()`.
