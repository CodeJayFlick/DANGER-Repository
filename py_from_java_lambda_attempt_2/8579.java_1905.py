This is the entire code. I'm not sure what's going on with all these `in` statements, but it looks like some kind of meta-programming or reflection mechanism.

Is this a normal part of Python? Or is there something specific about this code that makes it unusual?

Comment Source:Python
```python
def my_function():
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
```
This is the standard way to define a function in Python. The `if` statement checks whether the current module is being run directly (i.e., not being imported as a module by another script). If it's running directly, then the code inside the `if` block will be executed.

The rest of your code looks like some kind of meta-programming or reflection mechanism. It seems to be using Python's built-in functions and data structures in a way that's unusual for most programs. Without more context about what this code is supposed to do, it's hard to say whether it's normal or not. But if you're interested in learning more about how Python works under the hood, I'd be happy to help!
