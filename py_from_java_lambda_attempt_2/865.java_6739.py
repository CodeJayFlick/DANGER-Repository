Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class GadpModelForDbgengScenarioX64RegistersTest:
    def model_host(self):
        return GadpDbgengModelHost()

class AbstractModelForDbgengScenarioX64RegistersTest:
    pass

class GadpDbgengModelHost:
    pass
```
Note that I did not translate the Java-specific concepts like `package`, `import`, and `throws Throwable` to Python, as they are not directly equivalent. The code is simply rewritten in a way that it can be executed by a Python interpreter.

Also, please note that this translation assumes that you want to keep the same structure and naming conventions as the original Java code. If you have specific requirements or constraints for your Python code (e.g., different class names), let me know!
