Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class InVmDbgengModelHost:
    def get_model_factory(self):
        from ghidra.dbg import DebuggerModelFactory
        return DbgEngInJvmDebuggerModelFactory()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pass  # This is just a translation, not an executable Python program.
```
Note that I did not include the `DbgEngTest.assumeDbgengDLLLoadable()` method as it seems to be specific to Java and does not have a direct equivalent in Python.

Also, I used the `from ghidra.dbg import DebuggerModelFactory` statement to import the `DebuggerModelFactory` class from the `ghidra.dbg` module. This is assuming that you have installed the Ghidra library for Python (which includes this module). If not, please let me know and I can help with installation instructions.

Finally, note that this code does not define a main function or any executable logic. It simply defines a class `InVmDbgengModelHost` with one method `get_model_factory()` which returns an instance of the `DebuggerModelFactory` class.
