Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class InVmModelForDbgengFactoryTest:
    def model_host(self):
        return InVmDbgengModelHost()

class AbstractModelForDbgengFactoryTest:
    pass

class InVmDbgengModelHost:
    pass
```
Note that I did not translate any imports or exceptions, as they are not necessary in Python. Additionally, the `@Override` annotation is not needed in Python, and the method signature does not need to be explicitly declared with a return type (although it can be if desired).
