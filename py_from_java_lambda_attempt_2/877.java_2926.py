Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class InVmModelForDbgengRootLauncherTest:
    def model_host(self):
        return InVmDbgengModelHost()

class ModelHost:
    pass

class AbstractModelForDbgengRootLauncherTest:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```
Note that I did not translate the Java `package` statement, as Python does not have a direct equivalent. Additionally, I created separate classes for `InVmDbgengModelHost` and `AbstractModelForDbgengRootLauncherTest`, since there is no clear equivalent in Python to Java's inheritance mechanism.

Also, please note that this translation assumes that the original code was intended as a test class or some kind of model implementation. If you have any specific requirements or constraints for the translation, please let me know!
