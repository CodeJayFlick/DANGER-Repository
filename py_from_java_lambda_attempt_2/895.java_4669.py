Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class EquatableConcept:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def are_objects_equal(self, context_object: 'ModelObject', other_object: 'ModelObject') -> bool:
        """A wrapper for IEquatableConcept and its newer variants."""
        # Your implementation here
        return True  # Replace with your actual logic
```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent to Java's interface concept. Instead, we define a class `EquatableConcept` in the above code. The methods defined within this class are similar to those declared in the original Java interface.

Also note that I've used type hints for the method parameters and return value using Python 3.5+ syntax (`-> bool`). This is not enforced at runtime, but it can help with static analysis and documentation of your code.
