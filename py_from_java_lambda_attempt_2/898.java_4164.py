Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class PreferredRuntimeTypeConcept:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def cast_to_preferred_runtime_type(self, context_object: 'ModelObject') -> 'ModelObject':
        # This method should be implemented based on your actual requirement.
        return None


class ModelObject:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface concept. However, we can achieve similar functionality using abstract classes or protocols in Python. In this translation, I used a class `PreferredRuntimeTypeConcept` to mimic the behavior of an interface in Java.

Also, please note that Python 3.5 and later versions support type hints which are very close to Java's generics. That is why you see `ModelObject` as type hint for method parameters and return types.
