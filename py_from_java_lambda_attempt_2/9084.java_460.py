Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class PercentAnalyzedVTPreconditionValidator:
    def __init__(self, source_program, destination_program, existing_results):
        pass  # super(source_program, destination_program, existing_results)

    def create_post_analysis_precondition_validator(self, program):
        return PercentAnalyzedValidator(program)


# Note: The following classes are not directly translatable to Python
class VTSession:
    pass

class Program:
    pass

class PostAnalysisValidator:
    pass

class PercentAnalyzedValidator(PostAnalysisValidator):
    def __init__(self, program):
        super().__init__()
        self.program = program


class VTPostAnalysisPreconditionValidatorAdaptor:
    pass
```

Please note that the above Python code is not a direct translation of the given Java code. The classes `VTSession`, `Program`, and their subclasses are not directly translatable to Python, as they represent specific concepts in the context of the GHIDRA framework which may have different implementations or structures in Python.
