Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class RedFlagsVTPreconditionValidator:
    def __init__(self, source_program, destination_program, existing_results):
        pass  # super(source_program, destination_program, existing_results)

    def create_post_analysis_precondition_validator(self, program):
        return RedFlagsValidator(program)


# Assuming the following classes exist in Python
class VTSession:
    pass

class Program:
    pass

class PostAnalysisValidator:
    pass

class RedFlagsValidator(PostAnalysisValidator):
    def __init__(self, program):
        super().__init__()
        self.program = program

    # You would need to implement other methods here based on the requirements of your validator
```

Please note that this is a direct translation and might not work as-is in Python. The Java code seems to be part of a larger system (Ghidra) which provides specific classes, interfaces, etc., but these are missing from the provided Python code. You would need to implement equivalent functionality using existing Python libraries or modules if you want this code to run without errors.
