Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class AddressRangeListener:
    def process_address_range(self, min_address: int, max_address: int):
        pass
```
Note that in Python, we don't need an `interface` keyword like in Java; instead, we define a class with methods. The method signature is similar to the original Java code, but I've used type hints for clarity (Python 3.5+).
