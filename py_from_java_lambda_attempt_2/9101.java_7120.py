Here is a translation of the Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class VTAddToSessionWizardManager:
    def __init__(self, controller):
        self.controller = controller
        state = {}
        source_program = self.controller.get_source_program()
        destination_program = self.controller.get_destination_program()
        session = self.controller.get_session()

        state[VTWizardStateKey.SOURCE_PROGRAM] = source_program
        state[VTWizardStateKey.DESTINATION_PROGRAM] = destination_program
        state[VTWizardStateKey.SOURCE_PROGRAM_FILE] = source_program.domain_file
        state[VTWizardStateKey.DESTINATION_PROGRAM_FILE] = destination_program.domain_file
        state[VTWizardStateKey.EXISTING_SESSION] = session
        state[VTWizardStateKey.SESSION_NAME] = session.name
        state[VTWizardStateKey.WIZARD_OP_DESCRIPTION] = "Add to Version Tracking Session"
        state[VTWizardStateKey.SOURCE_SELECTION] = self.controller.get_selection_in_source_tool()
        state[VTWizardStateKey.DESTINATION_SELECTION] = self.controller.get_selection_in_destination_tool()

    def create_panels(self):
        panels = []
        panels.append(CorrelatorPanel(self.controller.session))
        panels.append(OptionsPanel())
        panels.append(AddressSetOptionsPanel())
        panels.append(LimitAddressSetsPanel(self.controller.tool))
        panels.append(SummaryPanel())
        return panels

    def do_finish(self):
        try:
            task = AddToSessionTask(self.controller, self.state)
            TaskLauncher(task, self.wizard_manager.component).start()
        finally:
            self.wizard_manager.completed(True)

class MagePanelManager(VTAddToSessionWizardManager):
    pass
```

Note that this translation is not a direct conversion from Java to Python. The code has been adapted and modified to fit the syntax and structure of Python, while maintaining its original functionality.

Here are some key differences between the two languages:

1. Class definition: In Java, classes are defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name. In Python, classes are defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name.
2. Method definition: In Java, methods are defined inside a class and have access modifiers (public, private, etc.). In Python, methods are also defined inside a class but do not have access modifiers.
3. Variable declaration: In Java, variables must be declared before they can be used. In Python, variable declarations are optional and variables can be assigned values directly in the code.
4. Data structures: Java has built-in support for arrays and collections (like ArrayList), while Python uses lists and dictionaries to store data.

These differences have been taken into account when translating the original Java code into equivalent Python code.
