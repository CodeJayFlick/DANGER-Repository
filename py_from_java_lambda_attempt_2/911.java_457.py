Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
# Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
# You may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

class DataModelScriptDebug1:
    pass
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `package`, `import`, and `interface` statements, so we can simply define a class with the same name as the interface in this case.

Also note that Python has no concept of inheritance or exception handling like Java. The equivalent to Java's `extends UnknownEx` would be defining an abstract base class (ABC) using the `abc` module and then inheriting from it, but since we don't have any specific functionality defined here, I've simply omitted this part.

Lastly, Python does not require explicit documentation comments (`/** */`) like Java.
