class DebugHostContext:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def is_equal_to(self, context: 'DebugHostContext') -> bool:
        return self.__eq__(context)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, type(self)):
            return NotImplemented
        # implement your custom equality logic here
        return True  # or False depending on the implementation

# Note that Python does not have direct equivalent of Java's interface concept.
# Instead, you can use abstract base classes (ABCs) to define a common protocol for subclasses.

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DebugHostContextInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def is_equal_to(self, context: 'DebugHostContext') -> bool:
        pass

```

This Python code defines two separate concepts:

1.  A `DebugHostContext` class that provides a basic implementation of the interface.
2.  An abstract base class (`DebugHostContextInterface`) that serves as an interface definition.

The provided Java code does not have any direct equivalent in Python, but this translation aims to capture its essence and functionality.
