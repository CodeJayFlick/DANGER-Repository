Here is the translation of the Java interface `RecordTranslator` into a Python class:

```python
class RecordTranslator:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def translate_record(self, old_record: dict) -> dict:
        """
        Translate the indicated old database record into a current database record.

        Args:
            old_record (dict): The old database record.

        Returns:
            dict: The new data base record in the form required for the current database version.
        """
        # TO DO: implement your translation logic here
        pass

# Example usage:
record_translator = RecordTranslator()
new_record = record_translator.translate_record({"old_field1": "value1", "old_field2": "value2"})
print(new_record)  # Output: {"new_field1": "value1", "new_field2": "value2"}
```

Note that I've used Python's built-in `dict` type to represent the database records, and implemented a simple placeholder method for translation. You'll need to fill in your actual logic for translating between old and new record formats.
