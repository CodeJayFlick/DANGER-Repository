## Code
```
```


This code defines a class called `IntArrayList` that extends `List`. It has several methods:

* `insertRecord(int index, DBRecord record)`: Inserts a new record at the given index. If there is insufficient space in the buffer, it will return false.
* `remove(int index)`: Removes the record at the given index.
* `moveRecords(int start, int end)`: Moves records from one position to another.

The code also includes several instance variables:

* `maxKeyLength`: The maximum length of a key.
* `bufferId`: The ID of the buffer.
* `instanceOfIntArrayList`: An instance of an integer array list.

The methods and instance variables are all prefixed with `int` because they are related to integers.
