Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python

class DebugHostEvaluator2:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def assign_to(self, assignment_reference: 'ModelObject', assignment_value: 'ModelObject') -> 'ModelObject':
        # implement your logic here
        return None  # replace with actual implementation


# Define a class for ModelObject (assuming it's an abstract base class)
class ModelObject:
    pass

```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java interfaces and classes. The above code is written in the style of Python, using classes instead of interfaces and methods instead of interface methods.

The `assign_to` method is a placeholder for your actual implementation. You would need to replace this with your own logic based on how you want to implement the assignment operation.
