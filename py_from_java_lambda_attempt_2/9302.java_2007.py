Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
class ReservedKeyBindingAction:
    def __init__(self, tool: object, action: object, key_stroke):
        super().__init__(tool, action, key_stroke)

    @property
    def reserved_keybinding_precedence(self) -> bool:
        return True

    @property
    def get_key_binding_precedence(self) -> str:
        from enum import Enum
        class KeyBindingPrecedence(Enum):
            ReservedActionsLevel = "ReservedActionsLevel"
        
        return KeyBindingPrecedence.ReservedActionsLevel.name
```
Note that I had to make some assumptions about the Python equivalent of Java concepts, such as:

* `Tool` and `action` are just objects in Python, so they don't need explicit types.
* The `KeyStroke` class is not directly translatable to Python, but we can use a string or an enum value instead (I chose the latter).
* The `@Override` annotation is not needed in Python, as method overriding works differently.

Also, I used the `property` decorator to create read-only properties for the two methods that were overridden in Java. This allows you to access them like attributes (`obj.reserved_keybinding_precedence`) instead of having to call a separate method (`obj.isReservedKeybindingPrecedence()`).
