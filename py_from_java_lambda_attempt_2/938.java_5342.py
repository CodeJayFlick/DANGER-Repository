Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DebugHostStatus:
    def poll_user_interrupt(self) -> bool:
        pass  # This method should be implemented in a subclass or elsewhere.
```

Note that this is an abstract class, so it does not have any concrete implementation. The `poll_user_interrupt` method is also declared as an instance method (i.e., it requires an object of the same type to operate on), but since Python doesn't support interfaces like Java's, we can only simulate such behavior by using a base class with abstract methods.

Also note that there are no equivalent concepts for exceptions in Java (`UnknownEx`) and Python.
