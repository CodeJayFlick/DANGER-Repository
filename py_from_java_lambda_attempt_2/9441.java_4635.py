Here is the equivalent Python code:

```Python
class PropertyEditorInitializer:
    def run(self):
        pass  # No direct equivalent in Python for Java's PropertyEditorManager.registerEditor()

    def get_name(self):
        return "Property Editor Initializer"


# Note: The above class does not have a direct translation to Python, as the concept of registering editors is specific to Java.
```

Please note that this code doesn't exactly translate from the given Java code. In Python, there's no equivalent for `java.awt.Color`, `java.awt.Font`, etc., and we don't need to register property editors like in Java.
