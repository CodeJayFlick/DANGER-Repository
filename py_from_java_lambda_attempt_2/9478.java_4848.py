class DockingToolConstants:
    """An interface to house constants used by the Tool"""

    KEY_BINDINGS = "Key Bindings"

```

Note that Python does not have a direct equivalent of Java's `interface` keyword. Instead, we define a class with all its methods and variables declared as static (using the `classmethod` decorator).
