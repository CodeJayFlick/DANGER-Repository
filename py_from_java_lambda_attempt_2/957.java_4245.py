Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class UnknownEx:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def get_pointer(self) -> object:
        return None  # Replace with your actual implementation
```

Note that this translation assumes you want to replicate the interface's functionality in a class. The `getPointer` method is replaced with a placeholder (`return None`) as there seems no equivalent concept of pointers in Python.
