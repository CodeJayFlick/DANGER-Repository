Here is a translation of the provided Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
class DebuggerRegionsPlugin:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    @property
    def provider(self):
        return self._provider

    @provider.setter
    def provider(self, value):
        self._provider = value

    def init(self):
        self.provider = DebuggerRegionsProvider(self)
        # super.init()  # This line is not needed in Python as it's a part of the class definition.

    def dispose(self):
        # tool.removeComponentProvider(provider)  # This line doesn't exist in Python.
        pass
        # super.dispose()  # This line is not needed in Python as it's a part of the class definition.

    def process_event(self, event):
        if isinstance(event, TraceActivatedPluginEvent):
            ev = event
            self.provider.set_trace(ev.get_active_coordinates().get_trace())
        else:
            pass

class DebuggerRegionsProvider:
    def __init__(self, plugin):
        self.plugin = plugin

    @property
    def trace(self):
        return self._trace

    @trace.setter
    def set_trace(self, value):
        self._trace = value


# Python doesn't have a direct equivalent to Java's @PluginInfo annotation.
class TraceActivatedPluginEvent:
    pass

class TraceClosedPluginEvent:
    pass

class DebuggerModelService:
    pass

class DebuggerStaticMappingService:
    pass

class DebuggerTraceManagerService:
    pass

class ProgramManager:
    pass
```

Please note that Python does not have direct equivalents to Java's annotations, interfaces or abstract classes. Also, the provided code is quite complex and may require additional context or information about how it should be translated into equivalent Python code.
