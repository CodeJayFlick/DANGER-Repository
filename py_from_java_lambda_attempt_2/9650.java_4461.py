Here is the translation of the Java interface into a Python class:

```python
class TextFilterFactory:
    """The factory's method for creating a text filter."""

    def get_text_filter(self, text: str) -> 'TextFilter':
        """Create a text filter.

        Args:
            text (str): The text used to create the filter

        Returns:
            TextFilter: The created filter
        """
        pass  # This is where you would implement your actual logic for creating the text filter.
```

Note that in Python, we don't have an exact equivalent of Java's interface. Instead, we can use a class with abstract methods (methods without implementation) to achieve similar functionality. In this case, I've used a regular class and marked the `get_text_filter` method as "abstract" by using the `pass` statement, indicating that it should be implemented in subclasses or elsewhere.

Also note that Python's type hints are not enforced at runtime like Java's types are; they're primarily for documentation purposes.
