Here is the translation of the Java interface `FindDialogSearcher` to a Python class:

```python
class FindDialogSearcher:
    def get_cursor_position(self):
        # TO DO: implement this method
        pass

    def set_cursor_position(self, position):
        # TO DO: implement this method
        pass

    def get_start(self):
        # TO DO: implement this method
        pass

    def get_end(self):
        # TO DO: implement this method
        pass

    def highlight_search_results(self, location):
        # TO DO: implement this method
        pass

    def search(self, text, cursor_position, search_forward, use_regex=False):
        # TO DO: implement this method
        pass
```

Note that I've kept the methods as abstract placeholders (`pass`) since their implementation depends on your specific requirements and Python code.
