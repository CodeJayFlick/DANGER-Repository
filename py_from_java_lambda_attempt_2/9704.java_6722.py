Note that this is just an example, and you should adjust it according to your specific needs. Also note that Java does not support operator overloading in the same way as C++ or other languages.

The `PositionableDimension` abstract class represents any dimension (e.g., width, height) with a getMajorLength() method for retrieving its length.
The `VerticalMajorRectangle` concrete class extends `PositionableDimension`, providing methods to set and retrieve major coordinates. It also overrides the `getMinorLength()` method from `PositionableDimension`.
The `WriteToConsole` abstract class represents any write operation (e.g., writing text, drawing shapes) with a `write(String)` method for performing the write operation.
The `PrintWriter` concrete class extends `WriteToConsole`, providing methods to perform various write operations. It also overrides the `close()` method from `Closeable`.
The `AssertExceptionPlacer` abstract class represents any exception that is thrown when no solution has been found (e.g., when a pop-up area does not fit within the outer bounds). The `throws` keyword indicates that this exception will be thrown.
The `ThrowsAssertExceptionPlacer` concrete class extends `AssertExceptionPlacer`, providing methods to throw an assertion error. It also overrides the `getMinorLength()` method from `PositionableDimension`.

This example demonstrates how you can create a hierarchy of classes and interfaces in Java, using abstract classes and interfaces as building blocks for your custom code.
It shows how you can define abstract classes with abstract methods (e.g., `PositionableDimension`), concrete classes that extend these abstract classes (e.g., `VerticalMajorRectangle`), and interfaces that provide specific implementations or overrides of the abstract class's methods.

In this example, we have used Java to create a hierarchy of classes for representing dimensions, write operations, and exceptions. This is just one way you can structure your code using abstract classes and interfaces in Java.
You should adjust it according to your specific needs and use cases.
