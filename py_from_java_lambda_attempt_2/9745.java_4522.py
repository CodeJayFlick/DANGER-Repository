Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

class TableFilterDialogModelListener:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def editor_value_changed(self, editor: 'ColumnConstraintEditor') -> None:
        """Invoked when the user types into an editor component."""
        # TO DO: implement this method
        pass

    def structure_changed(self) -> None:
        """Invoked when any change to the structure of the ColumnFilterModel occurs such as adding entries"""
        # TO DO: implement this method
        pass


class ColumnConstraintEditor:
    pass  # This is a placeholder for now, since we don't have the full Java code.
```

Please note that Python does not support interfaces like in Java. Instead, it uses abstract classes or protocols (in Python 3.x). Also, there's no direct equivalent of `ColumnConstraintEditor` in Python, so I've left it as a placeholder for now.
