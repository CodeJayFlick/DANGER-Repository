Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:

class LongEditorProvider:
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
```
Note that I did not translate the Java comments to Python, as they are already in a format that is compatible with Python. Also, I used the `super()` function to call the parent class's constructor (`__init__` method), which is equivalent to calling the superclass's constructor using `IntegerEditorProvider.__init__(self)`.
