Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
from weakref import WeakValueDictionary as WeakValueHashMap
import immutable

class IndexableConceptInternal:
    _cache = WeakValueHashMap()

    @classmethod
    def instance_for(cls, data):
        return cls._lazy_weak_cache(_cache, data)

    PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS = {}
    for iid in [
            IIndexableConcept.IID_IINDEXABLE_CONCEPT,
    ]:
        class_name = f"WrapIIndexableConcept_{iid}"
        PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS[iid] = globals()[class_name]

    @classmethod
    def try_preferred_interfaces(cls, supplier):
        return cls._try_preferred_interfaces(IndexableConceptInternal, 
                                             PREFERRED_DATA_SPACES_IIDS, supplier)

# Python doesn't have direct equivalent of Java's static methods.
# Here we are using class method to achieve similar functionality.

class IndexableConcept:
    pass

IIndexableConcept = object
WrapIIndexableConcept = object
REFIID = int  # Assuming REFIID is an integer in the given code, 
              # which might not be correct. It's better to use a unique identifier.
```

Note: Python doesn't have direct equivalent of Java's static methods or interfaces. We are using class method and dictionary to achieve similar functionality.
