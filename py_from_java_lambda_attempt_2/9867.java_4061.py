Here is the translation of the given Java code into Python:

```Python
class TableAddRemoveStrategy:
    def process(self, add_remove_list: list, table_data: dict, monitor=None):
        pass  # This method should be implemented by subclasses


from typing import List, Dict, Any

# Add this at the end to indicate that CancelledException is not defined in Python
CancelledException = Exception
```

Please note that I have used type hints for variables and function parameters. Also, since there's no direct equivalent of Java's `TaskMonitor` in Python, I've left it as a parameter with default value None.
