Here is the translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python:

```Python
import threading

class GTreeTask:
    def __init__(self, tree):
        self.tree = tree
        self.j_tree = tree.get_jtree()

    def set_task_monitor(self, monitor):
        super().set_task_monitor(monitor)
        self.tree.set_thread_local_monitor(monitor)

    def run_on_swing_thread(self, runnable):
        if self.is_cancelled():
            return
        threading.Thread(target=self._runnable_wrapper, args=(runnable,)).start()

    def _runnable_wrapper(self, runnable):
        if not self.is_cancelled():
            runnable.run()

    def translate_path(self, path, monitor=None):
        # note: call this on the Swing thread, since the Swing thread maintains the node state
        #       (we have seen errors where the tree will return nodes that are in the process of being disposed)
        node_for_path = self.tree.view_node_for_path(path)
        if node_for_path is not None:
            return node_for_path.get_tree_path()
        return None

class CheckCancelledRunnable:
    def __init__(self, runnable):
        self.runnable = runnable

    def run(self):
        if not GTreeTask.is_cancelled():
            self.runnable.run()

GTreeTask.is_cancelled = lambda: False
```

Note that Python does not have direct equivalents for Java's `abstract class`, `package`, and some other constructs. The above code is a translation of the given Java code into equivalent Python, but it may not be exactly identical in terms of syntax or structure.
