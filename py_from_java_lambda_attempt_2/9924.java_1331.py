Here is the translation of the Java code to Python:
```
import tkinter as tk

class GTreeClearSelectionTask:
    def __init__(self, tree, j_tree):
        self.tree = tree
        self.j_tree = j_tree

    def run(self):
        self.tree.after(0, lambda: self.j_tree.selection_clear())

# Example usage:
tree = tk.Tk()
j_tree = tk.treectrl.Treeview(tree)
g_task = GTreeClearSelectionTask(j_tree, None)  # Pass the tree and JTree to the task
```
Note that I used `tkinter` (Python's built-in GUI library) instead of Java Swing. The code is quite different from the original Java code, but it achieves the same goal: clearing the selection in a JTree-like widget.

Here are some key differences:

* In Python, we don't need to define classes for every single thing; we can just use functions and objects as needed.
* We use `tkinter`'s `after()` method to schedule the code that clears the selection on the GUI thread. This is equivalent to Java's SwingUtilities.invokeLater() or runOnSwingThread().
* Python doesn't have a direct equivalent of Java's JTree class, so we used Tkinter's Treeview widget instead.
* We don't need an `@Override` annotation in Python; just define the method with the same name and signature as the original method.
